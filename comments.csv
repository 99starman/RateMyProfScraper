4.0,3.0,A+,"Great dad joke style lecture! He cares about his students' understanding and wants his class to do well. The course has a very clear grading scheme -- webwork, 1 midterm and then the final. Half of the course is all highschool calc stuff (up until the MT) and then the rest is mostly new university calc topics which makes the final a bit harder."
5.0,4.0,A-,"One of the most charismatic professors I had first year. He speaks with a New York accent and will rarely go longer than five minutes without some sort of joke or witty comment. He also does a good job of structuring his lessons, complete with titles, references to an online textbook, and rating the difficulty of example questions. Phenomenal prof!"
5.0,3.0,A+,"Fantastic professor. He explains everything clearly, his notes are great and the pace of the class is perfect. Mind you math 101 is not an easy course but Professor Ward really explains what you need to know as well as techniques to get a good understanding of the material so you can get a high grade."
5.0,2.0,N/A,"I really cannot understand the people here complaining about his notes! The most organized and complete course notes I have ever seen, covering everything you will need to know. He cares a lot about teaching and the ""hard testing"" is completely fair game since the material is covered in class. Inspirational and brilliant. He makes you love Math!"
5.0,3.0,N/A,"This prof is the best prof Ive ever met! So good at teaching, able to answer all questions thrown at him. He makes sure that people understand the material. He also makes dad jokes in most of his classes. I would consider him a fatherly figure. I look up to him very very much."
5.0,3.0,N/A,"He is a gem. He is charismatic and does a very good job into making what is supposed to be the hardest Calculus course (out of Calc 1-2-3-4 series) entertaining and easy to follow. I have enjoyed his lectures so much until now, that I'm looking into taking another MATH course of him just for fun, or add an Honors Math minor to my degree. AMAZING!"
5.0,4.0,N/A,"I want to give a big shoutout to this professor. His course material is difficult, but I can see that he invested and continues to invest hours of his own time to help students who are struggling. The notes he posts on the webpage are handwritten, but are meticulously detailed. If I ever become a teacher this is the kind of guy I'd like to be"
5.0,4.0,N/A,Math 101 is by far the heaviest of all First and second year math courses of ubc. So much new stuff in one course. Micheal had great lectures and notes that helped a lot. You have to work yourself too because of the material. Brilliant man and very helpful to students.
5.0,4.0,A-,"Simply one of the greatest professors you will ever have. If you have the opportunity to take his class, DO IT. He is hilarious in this dadjoke kind of way and because of his experience, he knows the best ways to simplify the content so that we understand it. This course is hard, maybe brutally so, but I wouldn't take it with anyone other than Ward"
5.0,4.0,B,"The course is hard, but he teaches it as well as anyone could. His lectures have good structure to help you learn the basics of a concept before learning harder applications. He is enthusiastic and cares about how the class is doing."
5.0,3.0,B,"He is very caring about his students and really wants to see them succeed, but that doesn't mean tests will be easy. Very helpful in office hours and willimg to take time to make sure you understand."
4.0,3.0,A+,"You really learn something out of this course. Homework might be a little too much, yet is worth it."
5.0,4.0,A+,"Great lecture notes. Very invested in his student's success. Fair grader, great teacher."
2.5,5.0,A+,"Skips key steps in homework solutions, which gets rid of clarity you would hope the solutions would provide. Hard homework problems that class won't prepare you for. Be ready to be tested on all the math you've ever learned, not just what he teaches you in the course. Don't skip class, don't be late (or you'll be too busy writing to listen). "
5.0,1.0,A+,Perfect
3.0,4.0,A+,"Super clear in teaching, posts ambiguous and long homeworks, midterm was too long for the designated time, and I don't recommend taking courses with him unless you don't care about your grade."
5.0,1.0,A+,"He is just amazing. If you like math, you would love it after taking any course with him. You'll see someone on the peak who can explain easy and hard materials for you. HWs are time consuming, exams are really hard. but you will take something home from every single one of his classes."
5.0,3.0,A+,"For people who complain about him, idk what more they ask from a math prof. Ward is one of the best math profs I ever had (Anthony peirce too). His exams are way harder than hw, he posts all his notes online and the notes are very neat, but obv going to class helps understand the notes. Classes were a bit slow, but full of lots of examples."
5.0,4.0,A+,"Great professor!  He will challenge you.  He presents difficult ideas clear and effectively.  Be prepared to put a lot of time into this course if you want to do well.  There is no time to think on exams, so be a machine by at solving the problems.  The homework is time consuming, and the exams are a level above the homework."
5.0,3.0,A+,"He is a great prof, as long as you have a good math foundation, he will be able to teach you a lot! On the other hand, if you suck at math, don't blame him, he isn't there to teach the easy stuff.  His goal is to challenge the students, and give meaning to an A or A+."
5.0,4.0,0,"Man I absolutely love George, one of my fav profs at ubc, even though i'm now in my fourth year. The guy is a fantastic teacher and genuinely cares if the students are with him, he uses clickers very effectively, going over topics until people understand them. An absolute gem, in the CPSC department, a god among men."
4.0,3.0,A,good guy george
5.0,1.0,A+,Great professor who cares about his students. He is also very friendly and extremely hilarious. Assignments and exams are fair if you put the effort in.
3.0,2.0,A+,"Seems like an incredibly great guy and delivers a lot of passion to the lecture hall. That said, he does not prepare well for class, is often late and stumbles over his explanations. Could do with a lot more rehearsal."
5.0,1.0,A+,"A great professor who really cares about his students. Engaging and informative lectures, and absolutely hilarious. Also very fair exams and workload."
2.5,3.0,A-,"George is a great guy; his lectures are entertaining and he is very approachable. However, he sometimes gets confused with some of the material, which in turn confuses students. You'll have to get used to the accent, but it's nothing major. I really liked his class. His exams are fair and so is the grading. "
2.5,4.0,A-,"Hard to understand. Says stuff like, ""how the step is gonna look like?"" I think he means, ""what is the next step?"" but it's hard to tell. Lecture slides are half written and inherited from another prof. Nice guy, pretty funny and also helpful if you talk to him. The lectures would be better if he wrote his own notes, or just wrote on the board."
4.5,2.0,A-,"He's a great prof. Everyone loved him in our class. He's amusing and enthusiastic, I liked listening to his lectures. His accent is thick, and it was difficult to understand for the first two classes, but afterwards it wasn't a problem at all. I would definitely recommend him, he's a caring prof who's passionate about his subject. "
5.0,3.0,A-,"Great professor, will definitely be looking to take a class with him again. Lectures were always fun and informative. Don't listen to all the people saying they couldn't understand him, he is more then easy to understand. If you are fluent in English you will not have a problem. "
2.5,1.0,A-,"Material is easy. I can't understand anything he says, so there is no point to attending his lectures if the 3% iClicker marks aren't important to you.   Not to say he's not a good guy. He's pretty awesome. "
3.5,4.0,A-,Needs a while to get used to his accent.
2.5,5.0,A-,Useful material but very likely to lower your GPA. I would not take this class unless you need it for something specific.
5.0,2.0,A-,"No one can explain a concept as clearly as George. He's a wonderful prof; very kind and patient too. Labs were fun, classroom lectures  were lively, and if you ever go to his office hours your confusions will be swept away by his clarifications. Labs were relevant to student learning and he cracks jokes every once in awhile. Fantastic time in 213."
4.5,2.0,A-,Best professor.
4.0,2.0,A-,"I've had George 3 times already, and each time he has proven himself one of the best CPSC instructors at UBC. The accent at first may be difficult, and he has to backtrack a lot, but the most helpful and caring prof around!"
4.0,3.0,A-,"Amazing prof! Knows what he's talking about, negotiable and approachable in office hours, and once you get past the accent, will explain anything you ask well and passionately. Definitely taking another course with him."
4.0,1.0,A-,"George is rad, he has a little bit of an accent which honestly helps get you through how dry the course material can be at times.  I literally jumped for joy when I realized I had him again next semester."
5.0,2.0,A-,"Following George, you will achieve success easily!"
4.0,3.0,A-,I recommend taking this course with George - he put a lot of effort into the in-class examples. He has a bit of an accent but it only adds to the hilariousness of his jokes! Ops! He really seems to care that his students understand the material. It's a definite advantage for CPSC 313.
4.0,2.0,A-,"George is a really funny and caring professor who needs to get more sleep at night. His accent can be a bit difficult to understands and the lectures fairly dry from time to time but that's life. The course content gets progressively more difficult as it goes on. He can be very lenient. Don't bother asking him ""do you even lift?"" The answer is yes."
1.0,5.0,0,"The comment below me, that says he sucks? Well he does, AVOID UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES IF POSSIBLE!!! I feel bad for the students who have to take his class, get ready to lose all interest in coding"
1.0,5.0,0,"In one line, quite possibly the worst teacher I've ever had. He will spend all lectures talking about memory, and then the midterm will have one question on it worth only 5%. Refuses to help, and isn't even nice about it. Single handedly made me lose interest in coding, which was my favorite topic prior to him. Highly unrecommended, just terrible"
1.0,5.0,0,"Completely useless prof, goes on tangents unrelated to the topic at hand regularly. Highly unrecommended."
1.0,4.0,0,"Hardly ever taught on code writing. Going for lectures is a waste of time since you won't learn much and to do the labs, you'll probably need to google most of the stuff or ask the TAs. The TAs are more helpful than he is."
1.0,4.0,0,"Ineffective instructor. Never taught anything about writing code. Tests were alright, but several labs had vague instructions and involved the use of material that you haven't even learned yet/ had minimal experience in, which then led to you having to google everything. Labs are also must-pass even though they're only worth 10%."
1.0,4.0,0,"Very poor lecturer.Sarcastic and condescending when replying to students. Taught a lot on theory but barely touched on actual code writing, leaving students to fend for themselves during lab sessions."
1.5,5.0,0,"be ready to learn the book by heart, and then add stuff discussed in class to it. If using Big C++ it's a good idea to read till chap 8 before classes start as you'll be expected to know everything by week 3 anyway. Lects are rambles with very few concrete ideas put forth in articulate form. Wont do much to encourage an interest in comps/programmin"
2.0,3.0,0,Course felt completely disorganized. Will not teach you fundamental coding. You'll do better with online tutorials. Definitely not familiar with technical writing or good lab/lecture formatting. avoid him if possible. Thankfully there is now an alternative instructor!!! Everyone's poor ratings are accurate.
1.5,4.0,0,"Extremely boring and tedious assignments, labs and lectures.    He'll teach you lots of definitions and theories on good programming practice, but unfortunately he won't actually teach you anything practical."
2.0,3.0,0,boo
4.5,2.0,0,Very clear in explaining the concept. One of the most useful courses!
4.5,2.0,0,"Very thorough teacher.  I had no prior knowledge of C++, but it does not matter with this teacher.  Just keep up with the assignments and pay attention in class and you will see he does teach the material very well.  I did not even own the textbook and still managed to get 89% with just his lecture slides.  Definitely recommend him for the future."
1.0,4.0,0,Pretty confusing professor and WAY too long-winded (the labs and assignments feel like novels). He should probably take APSC 201 and learn a little something about the importance of being concise. The course itself also expects us to already know C++ after taking one course in C which was pretty useless as well...
1.0,5.0,0,"The course is not designed well at all, and the prof doesn't do anything to make it any better. His teaching is good in no aspects, and lacking in all. It's a shame the course is mandatory, because you'd learn more spending a bit of time on google."
1.0,5.0,0,"Probably the worst prof. I've ever had. Honestly, students should not be subjected to his lecturing. I hope no one ever has to listen to him again."
1.0,5.0,0,Avoid this prof at all costs.
2.0,3.0,0,"the course itself has more problems than the prof does. The main problem is the big gap b/w apsc160&cpsc260 for people who don't have c++ background. EECE department needs to do something about it. e.g.split it into two courses.but, the prof himself is not effective. he knew the stuff well, but he didn't know deliver the knowledge to the students."
1.5,2.0,0,Very ineffective prof. Presentations are unclear and too much irrelavent talking in class. Course materials are inorganized. Expect to learn everything by yourself. Try your best doing the labs/assignments since midterms/finals are heavily based on them. WebCT is really helpful too when you have questions or want to look up stuffs.
1.0,5.0,,- worst prof ever.  it's like he hypnotizes you into sleeping during lectures by making the simplest concept so convoluted and confusing that eventually causes the entire class to pass out. Successfully discouraged students from enjoying programming. Effective demotivator. Arrogant and has poor course structure.
4.5,3.0,,"Pretty interesting prof. Extremely helpful on webct once you ask a question. Lectures are interesting and make sense, though he often goes off topic a little by using weird analogies. Assignemts are hard, but extremely helpful to understanding."
5.0,1.0,0,Great guy!
5.0,3.0,0,"Great Prof, too bad he only did one class, if he teaches again definitely sign up."
5.0,4.0,0,"I love this guy. Seems like a genius, super clear, and very human. He's the guy that invented WebCT. Murray, will you father my child? :-)"
5.0,2.0,0,OMG do yourself a favour and take a course with him. He is so passionate about teaching that I can feel the energy coming from him. Really helpful after class and very clear in teaching. He is really knowledgeable and can communicate it effectively. LOved his class. Probably the best prof I has so far.
5.0,3.0,,"definitly recommend taking 315 with him.
 best damn prof around"
5.0,2.0,,"Excellent Professor.  He's energetic, enthustiastic, and brings clarity to the topic he discusses.  His Silicon Chalk program still needs some kinks worked out but having full recordings of his lectures definately helped my studies."
5.0,2.0,,"Awesome teacher with great enthusiasm and interest in the course.  Exams were fair and assignments, though challenging, actually made you learn stuff."
5.0,2.0,,Best teacher I've ever had.
4.0,2.0,,one of the best com sci prof. super-energetic! I really love his lecture :)
5.0,1.0,,"Great prof.  One of the 3 best at UBC imo.  Very helpful after class if you need it, but you probably won't because his explanations are great.  If you come to the lectures, you shouldn't have any problems with the tests either."
4.5,3.0,N/A,A motivated and energetic proff.  Interacts well with students and stimulates to think.
4.5,1.0,,He's a great teacher. I definately recommend taking CPSC 315 with him.
5.0,2.0,,"Excellent guy; often away on business.  Fun, clear lectures, and exams are *NOT* particularly difficult.  Routinely disorganized.  Strongly recommended"
3.0,3.0,,"When the professor is absent for more than a month during a 4-month term, nothing can be interesting -it's because he is the CEO of his own company... Maybe we have not paid enough to have a full time professor."
3.5,4.0,,Can't really ask for more. He said he loves teaching. Exams are hard.
1.5,4.0,,"Not organized, comes poorly prepared to class, rumbling, difficult to follow in lectures."
1.0,4.0,,"Absolutely terrible! The workload unjustified, and examples non-sensical."
4.5,1.0,,Very helpful and very fun. One of the best prof in compsci
5.0,2.0,,"great prof, usefull and interesting course"
4.5,3.0,,"Busy on his CEO job, so have little time for the course, but good at teaching"
1.0,3.0,A,"exams are interesting. that said he isn't a miracle worker, it's calculus and you need to do your own studying. If class was mandatory I wouldn't take him, but if you know calculus inside out and skip class he's passable"
1.5,4.0,A,really boring
1.0,5.0,A,Just terrible.
2.5,4.0,D,"Prof. Peterson is a brilliant man, but unfortunately, this doesn't translate to his teaching skills. He has a bad habit of cramming content onto a single blackboard making it difficult to read, and he still mumbles to the class. He did however recently move towards a typed exam papers. Based off past reviews here, he has shown large improvement."
4.0,3.0,D,He makes good explanation to every point we need to learn
1.5,4.0,D,"Awful prof, you will NOT learn a thing from him."
1.0,3.0,N/A,"He has no office hours, and he doesn't reply to e-mails very well. He seems to be busy after lectures to ask questions and doesn't show up to lectures until 2-3 minutes beforehand. His lectures are long, and although he is very knowledgeable, his explanations aren't always clear. Also, he uses the blackboard and his writing can get very messy."
1.0,3.0,N/A,"Stats major so I've taken a lot of Math courses. Peterson is definitely the worst prof I've never had. His writing are messy and lectures are boring and useless. He is knowledgeable, but  he is not good at teaching. If you wanna get ok mark, READ the textbook by yourself."
3.5,3.0,N/A,I do not understand why he gets such a bad rep. He is really clear in his teaching and passionate about his subject. His office hours are fantastic.
3.5,3.0,N/A,Always nice and helpful the few times I talked to him in-class. Doesn't use iclicker. Lectures are understandable but not needed to get a decent grade.  Course website is very helpful with plenty of information and problems.                     
1.0,5.0,N/A,I was verbally abused by this man. He should not be teaching. I strongly urge you to be careful if you are talking to him alone in person.
1.0,5.0,N/A,Really boring and talks too much about something pretty obvious instead of core concepts
5.0,3.0,N/A,"A fast talker, but a good teacher."
3.5,3.0,B,Prof Peterson gets a bad rep. Lots of students don't like him because he doesn't take their crap when he is teaching. (i.e. if people are talking when he is lecturing he tells them off). He is a good math prof where it matters. He is knowledgeable and good at proving where the math comes from instead of just giving formulas. go to his office hours!
1.0,5.0,B,Horrible..... Just plain horrible
1.0,5.0,B,"DO NOT TAKE! WORST PROF EVER AT UBC! he fell asleep in front of me during an office hour, very unprofessional and could not answer my questions"
1.0,5.0,B,"the worst prof I've ever had at UBC, no comparison, unbeatable! rude in class, ignore students' questions,etc. He almost made me give up math. My nightmare at UBC"
1.0,5.0,B,"writing this review in class, this is the worst prof I have ever had."
1.0,5.0,B,"Enjoys rushing through materials, and unwilling to match the learning pace of students. Results in tendency to NOT answer questions, and jarring differences in exam vs course materials. Also has a fondness for mumbling, hence often blames students for ignoring his instructions (even though his audible range is 3 feet in front of him). AVOID! AVOID!"
1.0,5.0,B,AVOID. AT. ALL. COST.
1.0,5.0,0,I trusted all those good reviews but I felt the exact opposite...
5.0,4.0,0,"Katherine Sirluck is amazing. She sincerely cares for the wellbeing and improvement of every students' work, strives for the best way to be helpful to her students, and writes the best constructive feedback that students can actually improve from. She is by far the most insightful professor I have ever taken a class in. I learned so much from her."
5.0,3.0,0,"Dr Sirluck is so engaging and inspiring! She chooses great literary works to study, shares with us her reading of the work, and encourages everyone to share their own interpretation, accepting all of them despite how vastly different they may be. She's very critical but leaves lots of good feedback, and prompts us to think further in discussions."
5.0,3.0,A+,"Sirluck is incredible, not least because she's able to make 17th century lit a fascinating subject; her lectures are downright masterworks of eloquence, though if you don't pay attention you will lose the plot; the class average was quite high, so she is not too tough a marker, or rather she is generous and open-minded, unlike many profs out there"
5.0,3.0,A+,"Honestly, one of the best professors I've had to date. I've never been overly interested in classical literature before, but she took texts that bored me to death when I'd been forced to study them before and lit them on fire. She's great."
5.0,3.0,A,"These reviews are the reason I enrolled in English 220, I was looking for something along those lines for an elective and couldn't miss the chance. Let me tell you, it's all true. Dr. Sirluck is simply the best. The course changed the way I relate to the world by encouraging me to think about it through the eyes of literature and history. Take it!"
5.0,3.0,A,"Really, really good lecturer. I've never really been into classical literature before, but I thoroughly enjoyed going to her classes."
5.0,4.0,A,"Top five if not the top of all English profs throughout my years at UBC. Highly recommend. Above all, shes fair, quick with good advice, funny and brilliant!"
4.0,3.0,A,"Super fun to listen to. Makes the texts come alive with her theatrical, dramatic readings and always engages students. She does make a ton of references that you will not get if you don't do the readings, but will undoubtedly accept any views that you have as long as you back them up. Very encouraging of independent thought, and quite funny."
5.0,3.0,A-,"Dr. Sirluck renewed my passion for my degree. Her intelligence and knowledge about Shakespeare was truly inspirational. I learned so much in every lecture and she was genuinely respectful of students, wanted to help you learn and succeed, and was born to be a teacher. Her sense of humour made every class enjoyable. The best prof I've ever had."
5.0,3.0,A,"Sirluck is without a doubt one of the best profs i've ever had. Coming into the class, I was worried it would be boring (literature up to the 18th century) but Sirluck made each reading and lecture super interesting! She allowed student discussion to bring up points she might not agree with, but still treated the opinions as valuable."
5.0,1.0,A,Professor Sirluck is the best professor of all time... aside from maybe one or two others.  Definitely the most charismatic and enthusiastic.
4.5,3.0,A,Prof. Sirluck is an amazing lecturer! I felt like I left every class having learned a lot (which can be pretty rare with a lot of English profs). Classes are always interesting and engaging and you can tell she's really passionate about the material. Very fair marker. Definitely take her class if you get the chance.
3.0,2.0,A,"Her lectures are quite informative, but I really don't understand what all the hype is about. There are many English profs at UBC who are as equally, if not more, insightful and interesting. I personally found her to be quite intimidating and condescending during office hours as well."
5.0,3.0,A,"Dr. Sirluck was fantastic-- interesting lectures with lots of discussion, really made an effort to make everything interesting. She is a very fair marker and gives great feedback. If you put in the extra work, it does not go unnoticed! She's absolutely fabulous."
4.5,2.0,N/A,"Lectures flow organically and are highly interesting and engaging. She is brilliant, witty, and has an amazing grip on the content, but is not intimidating. Rather she is inspiring and fosters a wonderful creative environment. Easy marker too, which is so rare for a prof this good! Being in her class is a privilege, I can't wait to take more."
5.0,3.0,N/A,"Prof Sirluck is absolutely in LOVE with Shakespeare, and her passion is contagious! Really encourages participation, had mini-performance groups and marks fairly based on the clarity and strength of your argument, rather than whether she agrees with it or not. She's the kind of teacher you dream of having!!"
4.5,2.0,N/A,She's a fair marker and I loved her classes. She made Shakespeare fun and lectures were very detailed. You'll learn a lot
5.0,2.0,N/A,She reminds me of Kate Bush—she is the Kate Bush of the English Department. Lovely. Wonderful. Somewhat eerie.
5.0,2.0,N/A,"Was wary after the first few classes as she seemed very opinionated, but quickly changed my mind! Extremely passionate about Shakespeare but is willing to accept any view or opinion as long as you have a solid argument for it. Despite critical feedback on assignments, she marks fairly well depending on the strength of your argument. Great prof!"
3.0,3.0,A+,Content of class is the same for every section. The class was mainly him talking bout the french language and its history and then a group in-class exercises for practice that were actually useful but don't count for grade. If you want a good grade you gotta work outside class. Class was boring tho.
4.0,2.0,A+,"Professor O'Hagan may seem a little self-important at times, but I honestly don't think that it's that bad, he's just a realistic dude. Honestly, he wants you to do well, and he'll give you every opportunity to get an A if you do the homework (which isn't heavy). He's also very specific about what you need to do, and it isn't that hard."
1.0,5.0,N/A,Worst class you'll take at UBC
5.0,2.0,N/A,Dr. O'Hagan was such a sweetheart I loved having him as a professor. He could be a little condescending at times but I felt that he really cared about whether or not his students understood his lectures. Definitely would recommend.
2.5,5.0,N/A,"Was a B student in French before O'Hagan and now I am barely passing. I think he makes his tests much harder than any previous teachers I have had. Same goes for his compositions, which are very difficult and marks hard on them.    50 % for a final? And at his difficulty? good bye gpa :( Avoid if you can."
2.5,3.0,A,"Decent prof, bad guy. 3 Tests: ALL functions, nature of words. Other lessons hardly tested. He likes French & is decently clear, so an A or B is doable. But he's snobby, blunt & unaccommodating.  He lost my test, no apology. Expressed doubt toward my French ability based on previous grades years ago - so unencouraging. Got an A tho. Take that. "
2.0,4.0,A,Great prof!
5.0,3.0,A,"At first, he was intimidating but throughout the course he has gone to show how much passion he has for the subject. He was very helpful when asked and really was very dedicated to the subjects on hand. I truly enjoyed the class and think he is a wonderful character and a great prof!"
4.0,3.0,A,"Prof. O'Hagan knows the french language, linguistics, and general language history very well.You will get a lot of use of the textbook, and the online site. if you want to achieve high marks in his class, it is not hard but you have to put in the work like all other classes. He can be a little cranky if you approach him before class, but afters ok"
5.0,3.0,A,"Great prof! Very grammar focused, but teaches it well. As a science student, I was worried that it might drop my GPA but my French writing has become much better after attending this class and I have no regrets taking it."
5.0,3.0,A,"Great prof! Explains things perfectly and really puts obvious effort into his lessons.He won't use the textbook you have to buy, but he makes that clear. He does follow the online one. If you are trying to get easy marks, this is not the class for you. He makes sure you deserve your mark, and that is part of why he's such a great prof."
5.0,2.0,A,"O'Hagan teaches French and its grammar very clearly even for those who don't know grammar in say English. And since his native language is English, he knows where anglophone students are coming from. So he knows when to give a translation for a difficult word, unlike the native french profs. I wish he taught all the french grammar courses."
2.0,5.0,A,If you do not have prior experience in a French immersion setting do not take O'Hagan's class. His primary focus is grammar. Extremely challenging to do well without a solid foundation in French (above and beyond high-school/college level exposure). Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.
2.0,3.0,A,Seems like a knowledgeable and passionate man for a French professor but teaches grammar lessons orally with little or no use of visual aid. He also digresses at length about material marginally related to the course. Attendance was not that helpful for test review and independent learning is necessary for success in course.
4.0,3.0,A,"O'Hagan is a good teacher. I can't say his class was interesting, but that is the fault of the extremely dry course material. He is clear and willing to go over things multiple times. He is a fair marker, as the marks on compositions are calculated mathematically by the number of errors made."
3.5,5.0,A,"It's obvious that he is passionate about the language, and very familiar with grammar rules. It is tough to ask him questions when you don't understand something though, because he tends to get caught up in the grammatical errors of your question itself, and then get completely sidetracked. Tough marker too, do not take this class for easy marks!"
5.0,3.0,A,"Professor O'Hagan is very detailed, informative, and engaging. I'm pursuing French above the 102 level and I'm hoping to find a lecture he's teaching."
5.0,3.0,A,"I could tell many in my class didn't enjoy Professor O'Hagan's teaching, but I feel very fortunate to have attended. Maybe his old-fashioned mannerisms make him an awkward teacher, but his instruction was meticulous and interesting. He is definitely the best professor I've ever had."
3.0,2.0,A,"Kind and respectable man but not exactly the best at teaching :( His English accent is quite noticeable despite his fluency in French, and sometimes it's a bit unclear of what he's talking about. Markwise, he's quite reasonable, I ended up with an A-."
3.5,4.0,A,Willing to go out of his way to help students understand the material. Passionate about the language. Loud and enthusiastic.

Really cool personality and is one of the nicest profs! Office hours helped a lot in gaining understanding/help with the course."
4.0,2.0,A-,The lectures were clear and she was accessible. There were too many lecture labs for my taste though.
4.5,3.0,A-,"Dr. Murphy did a fantastic job teaching CPSC 210. It was not an easy course, but she was really good at explaining concepts. Go to her office hours if you're confused about something. She's a total sweetheart and would be more than willing to help you. ABout the class, it's a bit difficult, but doable."

4.0,2.0,0,One of the best lecturers and the most hilarious professor I've had at UofT! She's fairly easy-going and gave straightforward assignments (plus no final exam).
4.5,4.0,0,"Wonderful professor. Goes on slight tangents, but is so bright and witty."
5.0,2.0,0,I LOVE HER!!!
4.5,1.0,0,"Easy: only evaluation was one essay per semester, with attendance and participation. Friendly and unintimidating (and liberal). Committed and knowledgeable. Didn't take notes, as we were not tested at all, it made it difficult to listen, and her talks were engrossing. Lots of class involvement, and was available outside of class for questions."

5.0,2.0,,"Professor Legge was excellent. She was witty, intelligent, and poignant. As I was new to art history, she was willing to provide extra help. She was one of the best lecturers - never dull. She did, however, rush at the end of the course making it difficult to prepare for the final exam."
4.5,2.0,,"Professor Legge's lectures were well put together, they were funny, captivating and informative. Professor Legge seemed to know exactly what she was doing and only seemed scattered on the outside. She was always available to help and genuinely cared about her students.

I've never had a professor so eager to answer questions, assist students and expand on classwork. He is kind, respectful and so passionate about the subject - highly recommend."
5.0,3.0,0,"Prof. Keil's enthusiastic and passionate teaching style can make even the most dry subjects interesting. Great screenings, too- plenty of classics. His assignments in CIN201 might be a bit different than what a cinema student is used to, but he really goes out of his way to help his students. Great sense of humour, too!"
5.0,3.0,0,"Charlie Keil was the best professor I ever had! I can't say enough good things about him. He was so friendly, funny, intelligent, endearing, and always willing to help his students in any way he could. It was clear that he genuinely wanted us all to succeed and he was always there for us. Super interesting lecturer and fair assignments. Love him!!!"
5.0,1.0,0,Only had Prof. Keil for  a couple weeks as he was filling in as a substitute during the strike. Despite this he was a fantastic addition to the course that livened up the room after having a not-so-interesting snobby graduate student teaching. Thumbs up!
5.0,2.0,0,Going into university I had no idea what I wanted to take or wanted to do. I took his introduction to film course on a whim and he made me love in love with the art of film. I have found my passion and he fuelled my fire so pursue it. I love this prof.

5.0,3.0,0,"Brilliant professor. Clear, informative lectures on fairly complicated topics. Open to discussion on anything, and makes himself available for active dialogues with students outside the class. A good sense of humour doesn't hurt either, and a grammar stickler too. One of the best I've had all year."
5.0,3.0,0,"It's been a few years since I took a class with Keil and I still find myself having flashbacks of it. Interesting, engaging, funny and as charming as they come. One of the best at the school, hands down."

2.5,4.0,,Very nice lady but not a great prof. Her lectures were very monotonous and unorganized. She would just read from her typed notes and go off track dozens of times. Tests were very unpredictable. In order to get a decent mark you would have to memorize the entire 544 paged Bondanella bc you would never know what trivial question she would ask.
3.0,3.0,,"Interesting lady, knows her stuff and is passionate about it. Her lectures however were very unfocused and tests had a lot of trivia that was not even discussed in class or even alluded to.
 Overall the course seemed very disorganized, but she is a pleasure to talk to outside the classroom."

1.0,4.0,A+,"HORRIBLE. I love Canadian history and he made me hate what he taught. If it was not for me teaching myself the topics through extra research, I would not have passes. He is very dry when it comes to his lectures. The assignments were very easy though. One thing he did well was assignments. "
4.0,3.0,A+,"He does not use overheads, which makes his lectures a bit hard to structure in your notes. He also does not use online resources, which is frustrating. However, he is a classic prof: really intelligent, enthusiastic old guy who really knows his stuff. He speaks slowly and has a great lecture style. He was the reason I switched into History."
3.5,2.0,A+,"Did not do too well in the class because I messed up on the exam, but the class itself was a good class.  The material was interesting and workload was light. You need to go to class and textbook reading is only required for the final. He doesnt use powerpoints so unfamiliar names and words can be tricks to spell. Overall a good class, but 4 hours"

You may not get a 85 - but you'll get what you deserve, a thorough edu."
2.0,4.0,A+,Rutherford is one of those profs at UofT who is determined to keep the class average low. I can't wait to see him retire.
3.0,4.0,A+,"Lazy, but likable. Assigns an excessive number of textbooks (including at least one of his own); mid-terms are based on a complete reading of one, and the rest do not come into play until the final. Fine speaker; heavily supplements lectures with audiovisual aids. TAs do all the marking (you will not blow them away) but B, B+ is easily attainable."
1.5,5.0,A+,"He doesn't explain enough in lectures, and expects you to write exam essays like take home exams.  Too theoretical and unreasonable marker.  Best not to take his classes if you need to get into grad school - you are not gonna get the grades you need from his classes."
2.0,2.0,,"His course on approaches to social history is stimulating because he one of the few profs in the department who is interested in theory. Sadly, theory dates quickly, so it can all become a period piece. There is a lack of structure, but it can make you ask questions that are useful in research. But there is no rigour here."
4.0,3.0,,"I don't know what everyone's talking about - Prof Rutherford is one of the best teachers I've ever had.  His lectures are really interesting and well prepared, he's open to comments and he's generous with his knowledge.  He also has a good sense of humour - I've never laughed so hard in a class.  His ads are a bit outdated, but carefully chosen."
4.0,4.0,,"I enjoyed prof. Rutherford's courses very much:  bbviously, I took more than one.  I found the material both intersting and very challenging.

1.5,4.0,,"He mummbles a lot during his lectures, making it very difficult to understand what he is saying. I think he forgets we pay to take his class. He is extremely rude to students when there is no need for it- e.g. always wants students to ask questions, but responds rudely when they ask"
1.0,3.0,,"He mumbles about crap in his lectures.  He seems to be very angry, **** and disorganized all the time.  Does not know the meaning of "" human integrity "".  Once asked someone in front of class, "" How the hell did you get into University?"" and with that, I often wonder how the hell he got into the UNiversity bc he treats people inhumanely."
3.5,3.0,,"he's not that bad, and has a good heart. also very smart. the guy who says he's from harvard law, i don't believe you! how do you have enough time to cruise this site, lol... you don't have to lie: you can just say you think Art sucks"
3.5,3.0,,Great Prof.  I had him for international relations & american foreign policy.  He remembered me from my writing from the first course.  So don't think he doesn't know you.  Very strict in his classes but overall not a bad guy.
3.5,4.0,,"He's a good professor and knows a lot about the material he teaches. He seems strict and rude, but that's just his mannerism. He's not unreasonable, and his exams are straightforward. A lot of req'd reading, so be prepared to put in the effort and time."
1.0,5.0,,Terrible professor. The worst I ever had in university.
1.0,5.0,,"This guy is a clown of the highest order.  He once told me, my knowledge of American government would always be limited.  Now that I've graduated from Harvard Law School and am actively involved with the DNC in Washington, I guess we know who was wrong."

4.0,4.0,,hes a tough nut to crack
2.0,5.0,,"Worst Professor I had while at UofT.  He made a student cry during her presentation because he disagreed with her.  I dislike him not only as a Professor, but as a human being."
2.0,4.0,,Don't let his after class charm fool you.  His essays on Diplomacy were marked terribly by a disgruntled T.A. and Rubinoff did nothing about it!!!  Average on the essay was below 50%!!!!!!!!

2.0,4.0,,"Very intriguing, but tough"
2.5,3.0,0,"Had him long ago.  He was late to every class. Midterm grade was strangely low. He said - You didn't submit your paper...I said...yes, I did... and it is lying on the floor under your desk with a bunch of others.  He had to add about 40 points to my grade.  And adjust for all the others he had dropped on the floor.  Self-centered. Oddly arrogant."
4.5,2.0,0,"my favourite prof at mcgill!  very helpful, really knows his stuff.  i suggest this class to any econ major that wants to take a break from really mathematical and dry theory classes."
2.0,4.0,0,Yawn.... attended class a few times but learned close to nothing. I taught myself the textbook instead.
1.0,4.0,0,a very poor prof to say the least; can be unduly rude in person; very impatient if you disagree with him - even on academic issues; at times a very bitter man
4.0,1.0,0,"I've taken his class three times now.  Best class in economics.  Hopefully I will get him one more time before he graduates.  Don't bother with the readings, they are never on the exam."
4.5,3.0,,"Boring? Yes. But this guy knows his stuff and his lectures are pretty useful. His Final Exam however was not in the traditional Econ format, however it was fairly straightforward for those who studied and didn't cram the information in at the last minute."
1.0,3.0,,"For this class (econ) 209 the proffessor just seems like he does not care, he is always late, talks about the topics as though people actually memorized the text, plus you'll be stuck with short answer questions on the final versus all other sections who have multiple choice. Finally, this teacher talks as though he has crackers in his mouth"
4.5,2.0,,"One of the best profs I've had at McGill. He is so smart, handsome, verry funny and witty, and everything he says in class is meaningful. For this class, I didn't even buy the book, but went to classes everyday and took good notes. Do this and you'll be fine!"
2.5,2.0,,I went to four classes: the first two of the semester and the two quizzes we had. I didn't find the lectures helpful. Study the book and do lots of exercised and you'll be fine.
3.5,2.0,,"Great prof to go to with questions/requests for advice, which is sorely needed at McGill.  So even though his lectures can be all over the place remember he is pretty nice if you talk to him, but keep in mind he can be a bit blunt."
2.5,4.0,0,"one of these guys who was an anti-social nerd in high school who now finally has to learn how to interact with other human beings...at your expense. though the prof.'s a genius, don't go to lectures. the exams are pretty random but somehow you don't fail. study like it's your job and forget lectures."
2.0,3.0,,"Unhelpful Prof; isn't a good teacher and can't maintain a focused lecture. While ocassionally kind, he can be very odd in one-on-one discussions."
2.5,2.0,,"terrible at equations, but very fair exam. Overall nice prof, fair grading, but his lectures are unbearable especially for the math part."
4.5,3.0,,"Really nice guy, helpful if you go to see him, but he tends to go off on tangents in class and expects a lot of you for the final exam."
4.0,4.0,,"While lectures were not his strongest point, Grantham gave lots of time in office hours and really helped me improve my writing style.  Really nice and helpful guy, with lots to say, just be sure to excuse yourself if you need to go."
3.5,3.0,,"Pretty nice guy.  Course isn't that interesting, but he sure does know his stuff."
1.5,4.0,,He is a very smart and interesting person. He can't teach and his lectures are read. He doesn't answer your questions rather answers his own.
1.0,4.0,,"horrible prof. AVOID HIS COURSES. superficially nice guy, but can't teach to save his life; will shaft you (grade wise) if you disagree with him regarding anything significant"

1.5,5.0,,avoid if possible
5.0,3.0,0,Based old man. Smart as a whip. My second favourite philosophy prof. His seminars were always a highlight of my day.
5.0,3.0,B+,"The seminar I took with Dr. McCall (Topics in Philosophy) was a delightful class. The topic discussed was decision-makingi.e. themes of deliberation and determinism. He is brilliant, humble, and endearing in a grandfatherly way.  I always left his class inspired and cheerful."
4.0,2.0,B+,"Professor McCall is a charming old man (late 80s) who's been doing philosophy for ages. I had him in a very small class (15 people) on a subject which he loves (Time). At this very personal level, he was extremely friendly. His marking is very fair if you show the slightest interest in his work. Take a class with him before he retires!"
4.0,2.0,B+,"Phil of Law with Storrs was fun! The concepts were really interesting and there was barely any theory involved, just a lot of talk about real life examples and hypotheticals. The papers were interesting and marked fairly."
4.0,2.0,B+,"You need to take this man before he retires finally. Go to lectures, don't screw around on your laptop, and listen to his lecture, it's worth it. He is in his late 80s, has been doing this course for literally decades, but is still incredibly passionate, which will rub off on you. Standing ovation at the end of the last lecture."
4.5,2.0,B+,"Storrs McCall is a fantastic professor, brilliant intellectual, and a great man. The class is very interesting and he has a way of engaging the class in discussion."
4.5,3.0,B+,"He's really good at explaining the book, and that's really helpful because the books that we read for this class were not the easiest (Plato and Descartes, especially). Having a nice TA matters 'cause TAs grade your paper."
2.5,4.0,B+,"McCall is hilarious - keep track of his comments cause he's so funny ... but in terms of lecturing, he tends to talk in circles for most of the class about one vague point so you tend to zone in and out of paying attention. He's super sweet though, awesome prof. TA's mark hard at first, but they easy up as the term goes by."
4.0,2.0,B+,"storrs is easily the best philosophy prof i have ever had. such a cute old grandfatherly figure. i looked forward to his class each day. work load really isnt that challenging.. just four short papers. TAs are fairly tough at first, but once you know what they want its much easier"
3.0,2.0,B+,"no use in going to class, he just explains everything from the books. go to class for a fun time though, cuz storrs is the boss. he will give extremely clear examples so id you read something and don't get it, just go and it'll all make sense. don't challenge him, he's always right. very light work, only 4 essays and an exam."
5.0,2.0,B+,The most attractive man I have ever met. His intellect is something we can only aspire to.
4.5,2.0,B+,"Most adorable old man ever - spent class wishing he was my grandfather and restraining myself from getting up and hugging him! It really is story time with Storrs. Take this class before he retires, but to be honest you might find the readings a bit confusing if philosophy isn't your cup of tea."
4.5,2.0,B+,"McCall is the cutest old man alive. Each class is like story time! He's so nice and clear in lectures. I'm going to miss him so much! Class is not hard if you attend lectures and read the material. Four essays, 500 words, 15% each + Final exam. Not hard for a first year class but lots of reading! But it was all worth it for McCall!"
5.0,3.0,B+,"this class got me through first semester. he's so entertaining, going to miss him! i hope he knows he has inspired many of his students!"
4.5,2.0,B+,"Storrs is a sweet, adorable, old man, but this class is VERY basic. It is actually quite boring. The readings are easy and he goes over them in detail. He isn't responsive to objections though...Michel-Antoine Xhignesse better be your TA! He's hilarious and EXTREMELY helpful- a stickler for structure, but actually goes over the material in depth."
2.5,4.0,B+,Hard but awesome
2.0,4.0,B+,"Storrs is a cool guy, too bad he doesn't run the class. TAs are horrible and you will want to stab yourself during every conference. They are incredibly boring and the essays are marked without mercy. I advice you not to take the class. Join some reading group at your local library and you will probably learn the same amount."
4.0,3.0,B+,"Probably the most learned man I ever met at McGill - a pleasure to attend his class. He made philosophy interesting, but sometimes what he says can go way over my head. Take his course though, the final is easy if you study hard for it."
5.0,3.0,B+,"Fantastic Prof, fantastic course.  I'm actually sad that it's over.  Take it."
4.0,4.0,B+,"He is the JEWEL of McGill!!! If you are at McGill, and at least somewhat interested in Philosophy, seriously consider it. One of the very few profs at McGill that you actually sense fine wisdom without being intimidated. Lectures can be intense and papers can be difficult to grasp! (experience can be exponentially enhanced by choosing S/U option)"
5.0,4.0,0,"Brilliant, funny, cynical. Critical towards news, research, what she teaches and how she teaches : open-minded and energetic, she gives a demanding but excessively rewarding class. Naysayers will mistake her recent or unconventional data for factual mistakes : please be smarter than that."
4.0,2.0,0,"Pr.Lupien is very dynamic and clear in her explanations of the materials.She has her own ways to explain certain concepts that you may find very helpful.Her playfulness is nice but maybe towards the end a little over the top. Other than that, she is very approachable and overall it is a pleasure to go to class.Watch out for the group project though"
1.0,2.0,0,"I had a BIG problem with Prof Lupien. She said things that were incorrect in many of the lectures. She ACTUALLY said that neurotransmitters travel in vesicles after they are released!  If you took any physio course you will be angered by her mistakes, otherwise you won't know the difference. Easy A either way, no need to think..."
4.0,3.0,,the class is really interesting and she explains things well. her assignment isnt explained well though..the TA was really helpful as well(Rok!).the first month is very scientific but the next 2 months are the interesting parts so if u could get through the first month youll be fine
5.0,2.0,,"It's really too bad she doesn't teach more classes. Absolutely wonderful teacher. Her explanations are clear, fun, and up to date. She has a true passion for teaching as well as for the material she teaches."
4.5,3.0,,"Honest to goodness, take this course. Always interesting and stimulating. Dr. Lupien is clear, energetic and has a way of making everything interesting. Best course I have taken so far."
4.5,2.0,,"it really does seem like the best class in Mcgill! If it doesn't seem like this in the beginning, it will definetly seem like it in the end of the course and even after the course. You will be sitting in your other courses and wishing for DR Lupien to be your teacher: yes she is that good! Bonus: TA"
4.0,3.0,,"wonderful professor. highly demanding, but it pays off. i loved that she expected creative thinking and more than just regurgitation."
5.0,2.0,,"wow what a class
 non cumulative exam but actually forced to think and understand instead of regergitate 100 multiple choice
 interesting material all great teacher
 probably my fav class at mcgill so far 
 highly recomended for anyone"
5.0,1.0,,"Don't know if this matters but Lupien is freaking gorgeous. She gets my testosterone going so much, it shuts down my HPG axis. If I were a woman, I'd have an LH/FSH surge all over her. She's like Celine Dion but: a) HOT b) not old c) SMART and d) FINE"
4.0,3.0,,"I didn't realize how much I took away from this course until after I took it.  Lupien stresses critical thinking from all aspects...and that has not only helped me in my psyc and science courses, but it's helping in all aspects of my life. GREAT course!!"
5.0,3.0,,"Very interesting teacher. Knows how to grab student's attention and hold it for the duration of the class. Hard exams, but worth studying for. Celine Dion should be proud to have a resemblane to such a cool prof;)"

4.0,3.0,A-,"Chris Green is a great professor, whose only downfalls are that he's pretty advanced in age. His voice is a bit weak, and some of his presentations are outdated. That said, I would highly recommend this course to anybody who is interested in taking a history-based approach to economics."
4.0,4.0,A-,"Professor Green's teaching style is not for everyone, but he understands that and makes it clear from the very first day. If you don't take it seriously to begin with it's your own fault. That being said, Professor Green is incredibly knowledgable and very passionate about the subject. Possible to get a lot out of class but it's up to you to try"
5.0,4.0,A-,"Prof Green is the kind of Economics Professor I wish I had had earlier in my McGill career. He's incredibly knowledgeable about the material he teaches, though occasionally the lectures can be fairly dry. Very open to questions and willing to discuss ideas in depth."
1.0,4.0,A-,Holy he just threatened us that if ask to get a paper remarked he will drop the marker... How is he allowed to work.
1.0,3.0,B-,... he literally just said there's no actually grading scheme for this midterm. What did I write and what did he grade -_-
4.0,4.0,B-,"One of my favourite Econ professors at McGill. Sometimes borderline paternalist in his Chinese Econ lectures, but have taken multiple other lectures with him and the extent of his knowledge is invaluable. One of the only econ profs who will ground the material in real life and offer a bigger picture. Willing to help and a funny guy."
3.5,4.0,A,He's seriously one of the best econ profs at McGill. SUPER dedicated to his craft of teaching & the material - his ppts are detailed & he constantly updates himself on the info. He always makes time for students... He might not be the most friendly but he's really respectful & humble. His course isn't an easy A but it's priceless. 
3.0,3.0,B,"Goes off tangent with background info on whatever topic he is lecturing during class so it can be hard to follow sometimes. The PowerPoints are very clear and detailed so despite not doing all the massive assigned readings, you can still do very well for the final if you studied the PowerPoints well. Grading was 50% Term Paper50% Final. "
5.0,3.0,B,"This guy is the nicest, most dedicated professor I've ever met at McGill. He's patient, attentive to students, and truly loves teaching. The course requires some work and the grading isn't the easiest, but it's really all been worth it. I also recommend for students who want to go to law school."
4.0,2.0,B,"Prof. Green is really nice and very helpful if you go to see him. He's also extremely knowledgeable on the subject! Sometimes his lectures are a bit disorienting, but this class is pretty unique and definitely worth taking. If you do the readings its great."
5.0,1.0,B,Chris Green is literally the best person/professor I've ever had at McChill.
1.5,4.0,N/A,"Chris Green is an old and dogmatic professor, often very confused with his material and unable to speak a sentence without losing track of what he is saying.The class is interesting, be but careful, there is ALOT of material covered. Going to class is useless, just do the readings and read the slides. Overall interesting material but boring prof."
2.0,3.0,N/A,"Whatever everyone says, this class is NOT hard. Just read the course pack carefully and you don't even have to go to class all that much. The stuff is interesting, not gonna lie, competition policy and the feud between company mergers are way more interesting than economic calculations I've done in other classes."
4.0,3.0,N/A,"this man is a huge beauty and adorable- the subject matter of this class is dry but it's not his fault. he makes it more interesting and you can tell he loves it. he explains things really clearly and is clear about what to know for the exam, and you actually learn. would highly recommend taking this class"
2.5,3.0,N/A,"Only took Chinese economy with Prof. Green, but I think he is a model of how an Econ prof should teach undergrads.He is also one of the few profs in the department who, thankfully, takes a more holistic approach to economics not fanatically concerned with econometrics, and I say this a alum of the (calc-based) Honours Program. Fairly open-minded"
4.5,3.0,N/A,professor green is hands down one of the best in the econ department. he knows so much about the material and you can tell he really cares about it too. on top of that he is both likeable and personable. i recommend this class to anyone interested in economics because it offers insight into issues that many other mcgill econ classes dont.
4.5,4.0,N/A,Amazing professor! Easily the best prof I had at McGill. very stimulating class and he's really into it. He encourages you to participate in class and is open to any kind of alternatives to his explanations (as long as you have arguments). He's a tough grader but it's worth it
1.5,4.0,N/A,avoid this guy at all costs. very rude and arrogant. he's NOTHING compared to ragan/watson but how he treats students is as if hes  paul krugman and we're grade 8
1.5,4.0,N/A,"Definitely the worst professor at McGill. Insensitive, obnoxious, rude, full of himself. Incessant ramblings and digressions in class. Rude and unapproachable out of class. Avoid at all cost. I got a good grade but I hated this class and Green's personality."
2.5,1.0,N/A,"As professor for The Chinese Economy, Green was committed, passionate, and hard-working; regrettably, he was also dogmatic, tedious, and often confused by his own material. To his credit, the textbook he has selected (Naughton) is both excellent and cheap; just go read it and save yourself the headache."
5.0,3.0,N/A,"I think Prof Ronis is amazing, but I know a lot of people from my class would give him negative comments, so I am here to justify. His lectures are amazing, definitely interesting and he was there to make sure you understand the stuff he taught. Well, having said that, I know people from life sci would complain about the level of difficulty."
3.5,4.0,A+,Prof. Ronis is a God amongst men in the chemistry department. He is extremely intelligent but does not realise that those around him are not at his level. Most problem sets are extremely time consuming but are a must if you want to pass the course. 
4.0,5.0,A+,"Very smart guy who gives very tough exams. MEMORIZE his coursepack, redo his assignments and you'll do fine. Ronis is a very nice prof overall. And you can't avoid him if you're majoring in Chemistry!"
4.5,4.0,A+,"I thought Ronis did a good job of teaching the material. It would have been helpful if he did a few more examples during lectures, but if you don't understand something, you can drop into his office almost anytime and he will help you out. Exams are tough but fair if you attend lectures, study the course pack, and do the problem sets."
3.5,3.0,N/A,"Prof. Ronis seems intimidating especially in the first few weeks of the course. Try to do the problem sets on your own, copying will screw you over in the end. If you ever have questions, his door is always open and he loves to help students. The course pack is your bible, USE IT. If you want a good grade you just have to put in the work."
1.5,5.0,N/A,"SO CONFUSING. Lectures are hard to follow, and he rarely does examples which screws you over on the problem sets. Homework questions often have need completely new information that he never touches on in class. Grades after the midterm had ~16 F's, and 3A's."
3.5,5.0,N/A,"Challenging course but Ronis is a good prof, probably one of the best prof I've had so far at McGill. The main challenge of the course lies in the fact that one has to learn all the derivations in his coursepack. You might find that tedious but doing that, you really learn physical chemistry and not just a bunch of formulas."
2.5,5.0,N/A,"Very mathematically grounded course and brilliant teacher, and precisely why it was my favourite this semester. Notorious ""soul-searching"" course, but rewarding to those that remain committed."
5.0,2.0,N/A,"Students in this department seem to complain just for the sake of complaining. He is very clear in his lectures. His exams are tough, but fair. The only drawback is that he does not follow very closely from the textbooks, so attending lectures is a must."
1.0,5.0,N/A,"The WORST professor in McGill.. There's no other word to describe him but ""HORRIBLE!"" The course is ridiculously difficult. All you need to do is just memorize the entire course material.. He is also very arrogant. Good luck.."
1.5,5.0,N/A,"Ridiculously hard evaluations (Midterm, Final). Does tend to take questions directly out of the assignments for the final, therefore, memorization of the answers is a must. Otherwise, a nice and funny prof, albeit a bit arrogant."
1.0,5.0,N/A,"Brutal class!  I majored in Chemistry because I actually had fun doing org chem and was enjoying school.  After taking this class I am now doing a liberal in biochem and his course has left a bitter and sour taste in my mouth.  He is arrogant, belittling (unless you're as smart as him), boring, and completely unhelpful. Horribly hard course."
2.0,5.0,N/A,"Ronis gets annoyingly frustrated when you don't understand what he's teaching, even if you go see him after class for help.  Midterm was practically improssible (56 average) and he refuses to scale.  Ronis and CHEM 223 made me transfer into Anatomy & Cell Biology - no joke.  This course is NOT easy."
1.0,5.0,N/A,"Great guy, very smart.  If you are excited going into this class, good for you, I'm sure you will love it.  If you are in any way unsure of whether you will enjoy this class or not, this class is going to be the most painful experience of your life.  You will leave class everyday with a queasy feeling in your stomach, knowing you will fail"
1.0,5.0,N/A,Worst. Does not know how to teach. Talks to himself through the whole class. He's a nice guy but the guy can't teach at all. All he does during class is write the derivatives and expect us to know everything he says and writes. Notes do not help at all. HARD cours
4.5,4.0,N/A,Really great teacher. Hard stuff but he teaches it well.
4.5,3.0,N/A,Excellent teacher. One of few professors in Chem. Depart. who is mathematically clear. Ideal for students with physics/math background. Presumed to be hell for non-math chem students.
5.0,4.0,N/A,"Professor Ronis is an excellent professor.  He presents difficult material in a clear and methodical manner.  The course material is hard and he doesn't dumb it down.  The problem sets take a long time, and derivations must be studied.  But his tests are fair, he will spend hours outside class helping students, and he's an excellent lecturer."
2.5,5.0,N/A,"He (and most of the textbooks I've looked at to help me) skips a lot of ""minor"" details, so it always feels like there's a missing step (or 5). There's also a big gap between the material we are taught and the actual problems we are expected to do. He's nice and coherent, but he never actually does sample problems during class, just derivations..."
2.0,5.0,N/A,Memorize his ntoes and ur fine. Extremely hard class... He thinks he knows everything and hes not that funny
5.0,3.0,0,Reoriented my life. This was more than a class! Thank you professor!
4.0,2.0,B+,"Truly, Louis was a great professor. He's passionate, and that makes him vocal. Some hate him for it; some truly respect him for it. I'm the latter. He makes you think and feel -- what else can you ask of a course? Take him for a new experience that you wont forget; avoid him if you want the same old, same old. ATTEND THE CLASS TO GET AN A. "
1.5,3.0,B-,"Very biased, not even willing to consider other points of view. Assignment throughout the semester is very time consuming and grading criteria is not clear- incredibly subjective. Did not enjoy the lectures, though the guest speakers were very interesting. "
5.0,1.0,B-,"Chauvin is the best. To do well in this class, you need to know how to self-reflect and really be introspective about how you perceive the world. If you can't do that, you're gonna have a bad time. Personally I loved the class and found it really easy. He's an amazing guy, great prof."
1.5,4.0,B-,"Would not recommend this professor.  Although the course material is interesting, he solely focuses it on environmental issues - simply showing videos and preaching his views. He is knowledgeable about the issues he raises, but leaves little room for you to develop and share your own (sometimes differing) opinions."
5.0,1.0,B-,"Very good prof. The course material is not the most interesting nor is it intellectually demanding. However, his method is refreshingly original. Just the type of class that these uptight rich kids at McGill need."
3.5,3.0,B-,"Nice person, Cares about the class... be prepared to drink the coolaid if you want a good grade."
4.0,2.0,B-,Chauvin is a really great prof! By far the most down to earth prof I've met. Not afraid to say things that you wouldn't typically hear in a management class. He gives a different perspective. His class is not for everyone but I really enjoyed it.
5.0,1.0,B-,"I still disagree with almost everything he said, but I have respect for him. By far the most interesting prof in management. I leanred more from him than any other prof at McGill. Also no final or midterm, and nothing to learn, you're only tested on the depth of your thought. I highly reccomend him."
4.0,2.0,B-,"Meditation, awkward one-on-one chats with other students to start every class, hippie rhetoric...needless to say, this class isn't for everyone. But Chauvin is a wonderful person and is truly passionate about this stuff. I just felt like I merely paid lip service to idealistic liberal babble for a semester. Cute, but as a class, it gets old quick."
5.0,3.0,B-,By far best prof at McGill - it was an honour being Prof. Chauvin's student. Good to see teacher's like him still exist!
5.0,4.0,B-,"Amazing guy. Easily the best prof I've had at McGill. Changed my viewpoint on life (for the better). Ignore all bad comments about him, those people don't know what they're talking about. He should be head of the department!"
4.5,5.0,B-,"Amazing prof, for an amazing class (Business in Society). Seriously, I don't think anyone else could teach that class and bring it so such a level of introspection. This class is mostly about self-questioning, and learning about who you are, where society is taking us, etc. and he's really respectful of everyone's point of view. No midterm no final"
4.5,2.0,B-,"Amazing prof. No one at McGill will get you thinking as much as him, but not in a bad way. He breaks from the status quo of education. Will get you reflecting lots. If you don't like class with attendance don't take him, but if you don't mind the absolutely the best prof."
4.5,2.0,B-,AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING
4.0,2.0,B-,"Very, very interesting professor. While attending the class throughout the term there were times when I loved him and times when I hated him. That being said, his classes are very thought provoking and interesting. He is definitely not for everybody but I'd generally reccomend him for the experience."
5.0,2.0,B-,"what a guy, genius. not for students afraid to express their opinions. life changing and inspirational if you are ready for it."
4.5,2.0,B-,I very good teacher. Unique to the management faculty. Adds much needed balance to a managament school based entirely on Finance and big industry. I fully recommend you to take any class he teaches (Social Context/Business in Society)
4.0,2.0,B-,"If you're weak minded, you'll get caught up in his brainwash-propaganda and fast, if not you'll spend the sem arguing with most the class who are. The issues are relevant, his solutions are impractical; but you do come out different, better or worse. He's marks pretty rough; I've never got marks off for giving too much relevant info but here we are"
5.0,3.0,B-,"Maybe the most controversial prof in the faculty, but probably the wisest. This course will challenge almost everything you have learned in management and stimulate thoughtful examination of the way you live your life.  If you're willing to open your mind though, Chauvin may be the best prof you will ever have.  I highly recommend him."
4.5,5.0,0,I graduated ten years ago. If I close my eyes to remember the most impactful academic moment at uni- It was Nash's class on the cinema of the 1970s that stands out. I am now working on some oscar contendersofthis year.  In Nash's class I saw for the first time that someone could make a career out of something the loved. Unintentionally inspiring!
5.0,4.0,,"She taught THE most interesting topics (i.e. Sex, Gender and Reproduction in Horror Film - come ON) and made lectures, papers, presentations and even exams a total pleasure. She let us present on 1970s**** in her 70s film class, and even gave our group a ton of recommendations for films to watch to support our thesis. Tough, but made you want to w"
5.0,3.0,,"She was the best prof I had at McGill. I loved all five of her courses, and she inspired me more than any other film theorist I have known. She's shy, but amazing and brilliant. Also..a total hottie."
1.0,4.0,,She's the worst prof at McGill by far.
1.0,4.0,,"As a straight chick, I can't comment on the hotness. I will say, however, that her lectures were stultifyingly boring, and she was the least available of any prof. I've ever had at McGill. If you're into rote learning, take her course, it ain't special."
1.0,5.0,,I never enjoyed her course.  She was arrogant and very unapproachable.  She needs to learn a lot about communicating with students and treating them like humans.
3.5,4.0,,Hot professor...but very moody!
5.0,3.0,,sexy in a cute kind of way.
3.0,4.0,,teaches like a sexy cartoon super-villain.
4.5,2.0,,"Best professor I've had at McGill. Clear, entertaining lectures and her tests can actually be a pleasure to write. She will let you do ANYTHING for presentations and papers and help you when you get stuck."
3.5,4.0,,"for theory she's excellent... very clear, makes readings make sense... really really smart, does simpsons impressions... she's hard and strict but you LEARN and she made theory interesting"

3.0,3.0,,Delightfully sarcastic but on the verge of nervous breakdown.
4.5,3.0,0,"Great prof - there for you, especially if you put in the effort!"
3.0,5.0,0,"I've never had a prof give so much feedback on papers. He reads through drafts and responds relatively quickly to e-mails. That being said, I found him to be a hard marker. Although participation is worth a lot, he does not give much time in class to actually participate. If you have strong writing skills and like cinema, this class is for you. "
1.5,5.0,0,"Horrible prof. Uncaring. Cold. His lectures are incoherent, and it's clear he doesn't really like students at all."
3.5,4.0,0,"Despite the difficulty of this course, I must say that it was one of the most enjoyable that I have ever taken. Prof. Ponech really puts a lot of effort in coming up with interesting class discussions. This was one of those classes that stimulate one's mind. Moreover, he is very committed to his students and a truly nice and funny gentleman."
2.0,4.0,0,Don't.
5.0,4.0,0,"Best courses of my life were with Dr. Ponech. I took 3 while at McGill and took another while in a graduate program at another university. He is extremely bright, which makes writing papers very difficult because anything that isn't logically sound is pounced upon. Not for the faint of heart, his courses will make you think hard and long."
2.0,3.0,0,"Difficult readings.the material for the paper, the book the paper was on was examined after the paper was due."
1.0,5.0,0,"If you are going to take his class make sure you do your readings for each lecture or else you WILL be lost. The exam content is unexpected, he ask at least ONE specific question. No idea how I can guide future students to study since he doesn't prepare students for the exam:S all I can say is. good luck..."
1.0,5.0,0,DON'T DO IT!
1.0,5.0,0,"JUst stAY IN CLASS IF YOU ARE HANDING IN YOUR PAPERS OR $H1t WILL HIT THE FAN NO JOKE HE JUST DID THIS THIS MORNING DANGER!!!  But in all seriousness, Be careful he will fail you if you hand in a paper and dont stay for no reason.  Have a nice life!!!"
1.0,5.0,0,"I have never been so inclined to post on this site until I listened to Trevor Ponech. He has ruined the english language for me, as well as my GPA. Pompous and unnecessarily verbose, he is the worst."
1.5,3.0,0,"likely the most unprofessional and inept professor I have yet seen when it comes to actual teaching - to give an indication rather than give a set of criteria by which he evaluates your assignment he does the assignment himself and gives you this: I gave his essay to 4 other profs in the subject to see what they would grade it, the highest was a B"
1.5,4.0,0,"Hands down the worst professor I've had at McGill. What began as annoying quirks to his lectures, made its way up to him frequently insulting the class and our lack of ""taste""-- he is a pompous, angry man and there is absolutely on reason to put up with him unless it's a required course."
1.0,2.0,0,"This is probably the most boring class I have ever taken in my life.  I wasn't a fan of the prof.  To his credit, he seems to be really into the material. The good thing is I went to about 10% of the lectures and only read the stuff I had to write the papers on, and still got a B-.  Not bad, but learned nothing."
4.0,4.0,,"First-rate, fun on documentaries esp."
1.5,1.0,,No Comments
1.5,4.0,,"From the first few lectures, I didn't think this guy was gonna be SO bad, just a little dry and boring. But by the end, I literally couldn't take the class anymore. His marking was unfair and subjective and his poetics of the image class completely disregarded the CULTURAL element, turning it into a theory course. the worst, trust the reviews."
3.0,5.0,,"Let me say this: my film class was in the big Leacock room, with capacity for 627 students, and an average of 30 came to each class. PONECH = PRETENTIOUS & POMPOUS"
2.0,4.0,,"Boring.He repeats the same thing over and over again.  Even if it is an English class, you should be able to do well in a 200 if you have done CEGEP english.  He marked the essays very severly.  I would NOT take this class, he rarely talks about the films and I heard only complaints."
1.5,2.0,,"Very, very boring.  Class is extremely tedious and hard to sit through, most people only go to the screenings.  This is compunded by the fact that most of the readings are unnescessary.  THe course is easy enough if you can write well, but you will fail if you can't"
