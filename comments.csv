Prof Name,Quality,Difficulty,Grade,Comment
Michael Ward ,4.0,3.0,A+,"Great dad joke style lecture! He cares about his students' understanding and wants his class to do well. The course has a very clear grading scheme -- webwork, 1 midterm and then the final. Half of the course is all highschool calc stuff (up until the MT) and then the rest is mostly new university calc topics which makes the final a bit harder."
Michael Ward ,5.0,4.0,A-,"One of the most charismatic professors I had first year. He speaks with a New York accent and will rarely go longer than five minutes without some sort of joke or witty comment. He also does a good job of structuring his lessons, complete with titles, references to an online textbook, and rating the difficulty of example questions. Phenomenal prof!"
Michael Ward ,5.0,3.0,A+,"Fantastic professor. He explains everything clearly, his notes are great and the pace of the class is perfect. Mind you math 101 is not an easy course but Professor Ward really explains what you need to know as well as techniques to get a good understanding of the material so you can get a high grade."
Michael Ward ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"I really cannot understand the people here complaining about his notes! The most organized and complete course notes I have ever seen, covering everything you will need to know. He cares a lot about teaching and the ""hard testing"" is completely fair game since the material is covered in class. Inspirational and brilliant. He makes you love Math!"
Michael Ward ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"This prof is the best prof Ive ever met! So good at teaching, able to answer all questions thrown at him. He makes sure that people understand the material. He also makes dad jokes in most of his classes. I would consider him a fatherly figure. I look up to him very very much."
Michael Ward ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"He is a gem. He is charismatic and does a very good job into making what is supposed to be the hardest Calculus course (out of Calc 1-2-3-4 series) entertaining and easy to follow. I have enjoyed his lectures so much until now, that I'm looking into taking another MATH course of him just for fun, or add an Honors Math minor to my degree. AMAZING!"
Michael Ward ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"I want to give a big shoutout to this professor. His course material is difficult, but I can see that he invested and continues to invest hours of his own time to help students who are struggling. The notes he posts on the webpage are handwritten, but are meticulously detailed. If I ever become a teacher this is the kind of guy I'd like to be"
Michael Ward ,5.0,4.0,N/A,Math 101 is by far the heaviest of all First and second year math courses of ubc. So much new stuff in one course. Micheal had great lectures and notes that helped a lot. You have to work yourself too because of the material. Brilliant man and very helpful to students.
Michael Ward ,5.0,4.0,A-,"Simply one of the greatest professors you will ever have. If you have the opportunity to take his class, DO IT. He is hilarious in this dadjoke kind of way and because of his experience, he knows the best ways to simplify the content so that we understand it. This course is hard, maybe brutally so, but I wouldn't take it with anyone other than Ward"
Michael Ward ,5.0,4.0,B,"The course is hard, but he teaches it as well as anyone could. His lectures have good structure to help you learn the basics of a concept before learning harder applications. He is enthusiastic and cares about how the class is doing."
Michael Ward ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"He is very caring about his students and really wants to see them succeed, but that doesn't mean tests will be easy. Very helpful in office hours and willimg to take time to make sure you understand."
Michael Ward ,4.0,3.0,A+,"You really learn something out of this course. Homework might be a little too much, yet is worth it."
Michael Ward ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"Great lecture notes. Very invested in his student's success. Fair grader, great teacher."
Michael Ward ,2.5,5.0,N/A,"Skips key steps in homework solutions, which gets rid of clarity you would hope the solutions would provide. Hard homework problems that class won't prepare you for. Be ready to be tested on all the math you've ever learned, not just what he teaches you in the course. Don't skip class, don't be late (or you'll be too busy writing to listen). "
Michael Ward ,5.0,1.0,N/A,Perfect
Michael Ward ,3.0,4.0,N/A,"Super clear in teaching, posts ambiguous and long homeworks, midterm was too long for the designated time, and I don't recommend taking courses with him unless you don't care about your grade."
Michael Ward ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"He is just amazing. If you like math, you would love it after taking any course with him. You'll see someone on the peak who can explain easy and hard materials for you. HWs are time consuming, exams are really hard. but you will take something home from every single one of his classes."
Michael Ward ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"For people who complain about him, idk what more they ask from a math prof. Ward is one of the best math profs I ever had (Anthony peirce too). His exams are way harder than hw, he posts all his notes online and the notes are very neat, but obv going to class helps understand the notes. Classes were a bit slow, but full of lots of examples."
Michael Ward ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"Great professor!  He will challenge you.  He presents difficult ideas clear and effectively.  Be prepared to put a lot of time into this course if you want to do well.  There is no time to think on exams, so be a machine by at solving the problems.  The homework is time consuming, and the exams are a level above the homework."
Michael Ward ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"He is a great prof, as long as you have a good math foundation, he will be able to teach you a lot! On the other hand, if you suck at math, don't blame him, he isn't there to teach the easy stuff.  His goal is to challenge the students, and give meaning to an A or A+."
George Tsiknis ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"Man I absolutely love George, one of my fav profs at ubc, even though i'm now in my fourth year. The guy is a fantastic teacher and genuinely cares if the students are with him, he uses clickers very effectively, going over topics until people understand them. An absolute gem, in the CPSC department, a god among men."
George Tsiknis ,4.0,3.0,A,good guy george
George Tsiknis ,5.0,1.0,A+,Great professor who cares about his students. He is also very friendly and extremely hilarious. Assignments and exams are fair if you put the effort in.
George Tsiknis ,3.0,2.0,N/A,"Seems like an incredibly great guy and delivers a lot of passion to the lecture hall. That said, he does not prepare well for class, is often late and stumbles over his explanations. Could do with a lot more rehearsal."
George Tsiknis ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"A great professor who really cares about his students. Engaging and informative lectures, and absolutely hilarious. Also very fair exams and workload."
George Tsiknis ,2.5,3.0,A-,"George is a great guy; his lectures are entertaining and he is very approachable. However, he sometimes gets confused with some of the material, which in turn confuses students. You'll have to get used to the accent, but it's nothing major. I really liked his class. His exams are fair and so is the grading. "
George Tsiknis ,2.5,4.0,N/A,"Hard to understand. Says stuff like, ""how the step is gonna look like?"" I think he means, ""what is the next step?"" but it's hard to tell. Lecture slides are half written and inherited from another prof. Nice guy, pretty funny and also helpful if you talk to him. The lectures would be better if he wrote his own notes, or just wrote on the board."
George Tsiknis ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"He's a great prof. Everyone loved him in our class. He's amusing and enthusiastic, I liked listening to his lectures. His accent is thick, and it was difficult to understand for the first two classes, but afterwards it wasn't a problem at all. I would definitely recommend him, he's a caring prof who's passionate about his subject. "
George Tsiknis ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Great professor, will definitely be looking to take a class with him again. Lectures were always fun and informative. Don't listen to all the people saying they couldn't understand him, he is more then easy to understand. If you are fluent in English you will not have a problem. "
George Tsiknis ,2.5,1.0,N/A,"Material is easy. I can't understand anything he says, so there is no point to attending his lectures if the 3% iClicker marks aren't important to you.   Not to say he's not a good guy. He's pretty awesome. "
George Tsiknis ,3.5,4.0,N/A,Needs a while to get used to his accent.
George Tsiknis ,2.5,5.0,N/A,Useful material but very likely to lower your GPA. I would not take this class unless you need it for something specific.
George Tsiknis ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"No one can explain a concept as clearly as George. He's a wonderful prof; very kind and patient too. Labs were fun, classroom lectures  were lively, and if you ever go to his office hours your confusions will be swept away by his clarifications. Labs were relevant to student learning and he cracks jokes every once in awhile. Fantastic time in 213."
George Tsiknis ,4.5,2.0,N/A,Best professor.
George Tsiknis ,4.0,2.0,N/A,"I've had George 3 times already, and each time he has proven himself one of the best CPSC instructors at UBC. The accent at first may be difficult, and he has to backtrack a lot, but the most helpful and caring prof around!"
George Tsiknis ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"Amazing prof! Knows what he's talking about, negotiable and approachable in office hours, and once you get past the accent, will explain anything you ask well and passionately. Definitely taking another course with him."
George Tsiknis ,4.0,1.0,N/A,"George is rad, he has a little bit of an accent which honestly helps get you through how dry the course material can be at times.  I literally jumped for joy when I realized I had him again next semester."
George Tsiknis ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"Following George, you will achieve success easily!"
George Tsiknis ,4.0,3.0,N/A,I recommend taking this course with George - he put a lot of effort into the in-class examples. He has a bit of an accent but it only adds to the hilariousness of his jokes! Ops! He really seems to care that his students understand the material. It's a definite advantage for CPSC 313.
George Tsiknis ,4.0,2.0,N/A,"George is a really funny and caring professor who needs to get more sleep at night. His accent can be a bit difficult to understands and the lectures fairly dry from time to time but that's life. The course content gets progressively more difficult as it goes on. He can be very lenient. Don't bother asking him ""do you even lift?"" The answer is yes."
Kellogg Booth ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"The comment below me, that says he sucks? Well he does, AVOID UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES IF POSSIBLE!!! I feel bad for the students who have to take his class, get ready to lose all interest in coding"
Kellogg Booth ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"In one line, quite possibly the worst teacher I've ever had. He will spend all lectures talking about memory, and then the midterm will have one question on it worth only 5%. Refuses to help, and isn't even nice about it. Single handedly made me lose interest in coding, which was my favorite topic prior to him. Highly unrecommended, just terrible"
Kellogg Booth ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"Completely useless prof, goes on tangents unrelated to the topic at hand regularly. Highly unrecommended."
Kellogg Booth ,1.0,4.0,N/A,"Hardly ever taught on code writing. Going for lectures is a waste of time since you won't learn much and to do the labs, you'll probably need to google most of the stuff or ask the TAs. The TAs are more helpful than he is."
Kellogg Booth ,1.0,4.0,N/A,"Ineffective instructor. Never taught anything about writing code. Tests were alright, but several labs had vague instructions and involved the use of material that you haven't even learned yet/ had minimal experience in, which then led to you having to google everything. Labs are also must-pass even though they're only worth 10%."
Kellogg Booth ,1.0,4.0,N/A,"Very poor lecturer.Sarcastic and condescending when replying to students. Taught a lot on theory but barely touched on actual code writing, leaving students to fend for themselves during lab sessions."
Kellogg Booth ,1.5,5.0,N/A,"be ready to learn the book by heart, and then add stuff discussed in class to it. If using Big C++ it's a good idea to read till chap 8 before classes start as you'll be expected to know everything by week 3 anyway. Lects are rambles with very few concrete ideas put forth in articulate form. Wont do much to encourage an interest in comps/programmin"
Kellogg Booth ,2.0,3.0,N/A,Course felt completely disorganized. Will not teach you fundamental coding. You'll do better with online tutorials. Definitely not familiar with technical writing or good lab/lecture formatting. avoid him if possible. Thankfully there is now an alternative instructor!!! Everyone's poor ratings are accurate.
Kellogg Booth ,1.5,4.0,N/A,"Extremely boring and tedious assignments, labs and lectures.    He'll teach you lots of definitions and theories on good programming practice, but unfortunately he won't actually teach you anything practical."
Kellogg Booth ,2.0,3.0,N/A,boo
Kellogg Booth ,4.5,2.0,N/A,Very clear in explaining the concept. One of the most useful courses!
Kellogg Booth ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"Very thorough teacher.  I had no prior knowledge of C++, but it does not matter with this teacher.  Just keep up with the assignments and pay attention in class and you will see he does teach the material very well.  I did not even own the textbook and still managed to get 89% with just his lecture slides.  Definitely recommend him for the future."
Kellogg Booth ,1.0,4.0,N/A,Pretty confusing professor and WAY too long-winded (the labs and assignments feel like novels). He should probably take APSC 201 and learn a little something about the importance of being concise. The course itself also expects us to already know C++ after taking one course in C which was pretty useless as well...
Kellogg Booth ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"The course is not designed well at all, and the prof doesn't do anything to make it any better. His teaching is good in no aspects, and lacking in all. It's a shame the course is mandatory, because you'd learn more spending a bit of time on google."
Kellogg Booth ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"Probably the worst prof. I've ever had. Honestly, students should not be subjected to his lecturing. I hope no one ever has to listen to him again."
Kellogg Booth ,1.0,5.0,N/A,Avoid this prof at all costs.
Kellogg Booth ,2.0,3.0,N/A,"the course itself has more problems than the prof does. The main problem is the big gap b/w apsc160&cpsc260 for people who don't have c++ background. EECE department needs to do something about it. e.g.split it into two courses.but, the prof himself is not effective. he knew the stuff well, but he didn't know deliver the knowledge to the students."
Kellogg Booth ,1.5,2.0,N/A,Very ineffective prof. Presentations are unclear and too much irrelavent talking in class. Course materials are inorganized. Expect to learn everything by yourself. Try your best doing the labs/assignments since midterms/finals are heavily based on them. WebCT is really helpful too when you have questions or want to look up stuffs.
Kellogg Booth ,1.0,5.0,N/A,- worst prof ever.  it's like he hypnotizes you into sleeping during lectures by making the simplest concept so convoluted and confusing that eventually causes the entire class to pass out. Successfully discouraged students from enjoying programming. Effective demotivator. Arrogant and has poor course structure.
Kellogg Booth ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"Pretty interesting prof. Extremely helpful on webct once you ask a question. Lectures are interesting and make sense, though he often goes off topic a little by using weird analogies. Assignemts are hard, but extremely helpful to understanding."
Murray Goldberg ,5.0,1.0,N/A,Great guy!
Murray Goldberg ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Great Prof, too bad he only did one class, if he teaches again definitely sign up."
Murray Goldberg ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"I love this guy. Seems like a genius, super clear, and very human. He's the guy that invented WebCT. Murray, will you father my child? :-)"
Murray Goldberg ,5.0,2.0,N/A,OMG do yourself a favour and take a course with him. He is so passionate about teaching that I can feel the energy coming from him. Really helpful after class and very clear in teaching. He is really knowledgeable and can communicate it effectively. LOved his class. Probably the best prof I has so far.
Murray Goldberg ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"definitly recommend taking 315 with him.
 best damn prof around"
Murray Goldberg ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"Excellent Professor.  He's energetic, enthustiastic, and brings clarity to the topic he discusses.  His Silicon Chalk program still needs some kinks worked out but having full recordings of his lectures definately helped my studies."
Murray Goldberg ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"Awesome teacher with great enthusiasm and interest in the course.  Exams were fair and assignments, though challenging, actually made you learn stuff."
Murray Goldberg ,5.0,2.0,N/A,Best teacher I've ever had.
Murray Goldberg ,4.0,2.0,N/A,one of the best com sci prof. super-energetic! I really love his lecture :)
Murray Goldberg ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"Great prof.  One of the 3 best at UBC imo.  Very helpful after class if you need it, but you probably won't because his explanations are great.  If you come to the lectures, you shouldn't have any problems with the tests either."
Murray Goldberg ,4.5,3.0,N/A,A motivated and energetic proff.  Interacts well with students and stimulates to think.
Murray Goldberg ,4.5,1.0,N/A,He's a great teacher. I definately recommend taking CPSC 315 with him.
Murray Goldberg ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"Excellent guy; often away on business.  Fun, clear lectures, and exams are *NOT* particularly difficult.  Routinely disorganized.  Strongly recommended"
Murray Goldberg ,3.0,3.0,N/A,"When the professor is absent for more than a month during a 4-month term, nothing can be interesting -it's because he is the CEO of his own company... Maybe we have not paid enough to have a full time professor."
Murray Goldberg ,3.5,4.0,N/A,Can't really ask for more. He said he loves teaching. Exams are hard.
Murray Goldberg ,1.5,4.0,N/A,"Not organized, comes poorly prepared to class, rumbling, difficult to follow in lectures."
Murray Goldberg ,1.0,4.0,N/A,"Absolutely terrible! The workload unjustified, and examples non-sensical."
Murray Goldberg ,4.5,1.0,N/A,Very helpful and very fun. One of the best prof in compsci
Murray Goldberg ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"great prof, usefull and interesting course"
Murray Goldberg ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"Busy on his CEO job, so have little time for the course, but good at teaching"
Dale Peterson ,1.0,3.0,A,"exams are interesting. that said he isn't a miracle worker, it's calculus and you need to do your own studying. If class was mandatory I wouldn't take him, but if you know calculus inside out and skip class he's passable"
Dale Peterson ,1.5,4.0,N/A,really boring
Dale Peterson ,1.0,5.0,N/A,Just terrible.
Dale Peterson ,2.5,4.0,D,"Prof. Peterson is a brilliant man, but unfortunately, this doesn't translate to his teaching skills. He has a bad habit of cramming content onto a single blackboard making it difficult to read, and he still mumbles to the class. He did however recently move towards a typed exam papers. Based off past reviews here, he has shown large improvement."
Dale Peterson ,4.0,3.0,N/A,He makes good explanation to every point we need to learn
Dale Peterson ,1.5,4.0,N/A,"Awful prof, you will NOT learn a thing from him."
Dale Peterson ,1.0,3.0,N/A,"He has no office hours, and he doesn't reply to e-mails very well. He seems to be busy after lectures to ask questions and doesn't show up to lectures until 2-3 minutes beforehand. His lectures are long, and although he is very knowledgeable, his explanations aren't always clear. Also, he uses the blackboard and his writing can get very messy."
Dale Peterson ,1.0,3.0,N/A,"Stats major so I've taken a lot of Math courses. Peterson is definitely the worst prof I've never had. His writing are messy and lectures are boring and useless. He is knowledgeable, but  he is not good at teaching. If you wanna get ok mark, READ the textbook by yourself."
Dale Peterson ,3.5,3.0,N/A,I do not understand why he gets such a bad rep. He is really clear in his teaching and passionate about his subject. His office hours are fantastic.
Dale Peterson ,3.5,3.0,N/A,Always nice and helpful the few times I talked to him in-class. Doesn't use iclicker. Lectures are understandable but not needed to get a decent grade.  Course website is very helpful with plenty of information and problems.                     
Dale Peterson ,1.0,5.0,N/A,I was verbally abused by this man. He should not be teaching. I strongly urge you to be careful if you are talking to him alone in person.
Dale Peterson ,1.0,5.0,N/A,Really boring and talks too much about something pretty obvious instead of core concepts
Dale Peterson ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"A fast talker, but a good teacher."
Dale Peterson ,3.5,3.0,B,Prof Peterson gets a bad rep. Lots of students don't like him because he doesn't take their crap when he is teaching. (i.e. if people are talking when he is lecturing he tells them off). He is a good math prof where it matters. He is knowledgeable and good at proving where the math comes from instead of just giving formulas. go to his office hours!
Dale Peterson ,1.0,5.0,N/A,Horrible..... Just plain horrible
Dale Peterson ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"DO NOT TAKE! WORST PROF EVER AT UBC! he fell asleep in front of me during an office hour, very unprofessional and could not answer my questions"
Dale Peterson ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"the worst prof I've ever had at UBC, no comparison, unbeatable! rude in class, ignore students' questions,etc. He almost made me give up math. My nightmare at UBC"
Dale Peterson ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"writing this review in class, this is the worst prof I have ever had."
Dale Peterson ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"Enjoys rushing through materials, and unwilling to match the learning pace of students. Results in tendency to NOT answer questions, and jarring differences in exam vs course materials. Also has a fondness for mumbling, hence often blames students for ignoring his instructions (even though his audible range is 3 feet in front of him). AVOID! AVOID!"
Dale Peterson ,1.0,5.0,N/A,AVOID. AT. ALL. COST.
Kate Sirluck ,1.0,5.0,N/A,I trusted all those good reviews but I felt the exact opposite...
Kate Sirluck ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"Katherine Sirluck is amazing. She sincerely cares for the wellbeing and improvement of every students' work, strives for the best way to be helpful to her students, and writes the best constructive feedback that students can actually improve from. She is by far the most insightful professor I have ever taken a class in. I learned so much from her."
Kate Sirluck ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Dr Sirluck is so engaging and inspiring! She chooses great literary works to study, shares with us her reading of the work, and encourages everyone to share their own interpretation, accepting all of them despite how vastly different they may be. She's very critical but leaves lots of good feedback, and prompts us to think further in discussions."
Kate Sirluck ,5.0,3.0,A+,"Sirluck is incredible, not least because she's able to make 17th century lit a fascinating subject; her lectures are downright masterworks of eloquence, though if you don't pay attention you will lose the plot; the class average was quite high, so she is not too tough a marker, or rather she is generous and open-minded, unlike many profs out there"
Kate Sirluck ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Honestly, one of the best professors I've had to date. I've never been overly interested in classical literature before, but she took texts that bored me to death when I'd been forced to study them before and lit them on fire. She's great."
Kate Sirluck ,5.0,3.0,A,"These reviews are the reason I enrolled in English 220, I was looking for something along those lines for an elective and couldn't miss the chance. Let me tell you, it's all true. Dr. Sirluck is simply the best. The course changed the way I relate to the world by encouraging me to think about it through the eyes of literature and history. Take it!"
Kate Sirluck ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Really, really good lecturer. I've never really been into classical literature before, but I thoroughly enjoyed going to her classes."
Kate Sirluck ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"Top five if not the top of all English profs throughout my years at UBC. Highly recommend. Above all, shes fair, quick with good advice, funny and brilliant!"
Kate Sirluck ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"Super fun to listen to. Makes the texts come alive with her theatrical, dramatic readings and always engages students. She does make a ton of references that you will not get if you don't do the readings, but will undoubtedly accept any views that you have as long as you back them up. Very encouraging of independent thought, and quite funny."
Kate Sirluck ,5.0,3.0,A-,"Dr. Sirluck renewed my passion for my degree. Her intelligence and knowledge about Shakespeare was truly inspirational. I learned so much in every lecture and she was genuinely respectful of students, wanted to help you learn and succeed, and was born to be a teacher. Her sense of humour made every class enjoyable. The best prof I've ever had."
Kate Sirluck ,5.0,3.0,A,"Sirluck is without a doubt one of the best profs i've ever had. Coming into the class, I was worried it would be boring (literature up to the 18th century) but Sirluck made each reading and lecture super interesting! She allowed student discussion to bring up points she might not agree with, but still treated the opinions as valuable."
Kate Sirluck ,5.0,1.0,A,Professor Sirluck is the best professor of all time... aside from maybe one or two others.  Definitely the most charismatic and enthusiastic.
Kate Sirluck ,4.5,3.0,N/A,Prof. Sirluck is an amazing lecturer! I felt like I left every class having learned a lot (which can be pretty rare with a lot of English profs). Classes are always interesting and engaging and you can tell she's really passionate about the material. Very fair marker. Definitely take her class if you get the chance.
Kate Sirluck ,3.0,2.0,N/A,"Her lectures are quite informative, but I really don't understand what all the hype is about. There are many English profs at UBC who are as equally, if not more, insightful and interesting. I personally found her to be quite intimidating and condescending during office hours as well."
Kate Sirluck ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Dr. Sirluck was fantastic-- interesting lectures with lots of discussion, really made an effort to make everything interesting. She is a very fair marker and gives great feedback. If you put in the extra work, it does not go unnoticed! She's absolutely fabulous."
Kate Sirluck ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"Lectures flow organically and are highly interesting and engaging. She is brilliant, witty, and has an amazing grip on the content, but is not intimidating. Rather she is inspiring and fosters a wonderful creative environment. Easy marker too, which is so rare for a prof this good! Being in her class is a privilege, I can't wait to take more."
Kate Sirluck ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Prof Sirluck is absolutely in LOVE with Shakespeare, and her passion is contagious! Really encourages participation, had mini-performance groups and marks fairly based on the clarity and strength of your argument, rather than whether she agrees with it or not. She's the kind of teacher you dream of having!!"
Kate Sirluck ,4.5,2.0,N/A,She's a fair marker and I loved her classes. She made Shakespeare fun and lectures were very detailed. You'll learn a lot
Kate Sirluck ,5.0,2.0,N/A,She reminds me of Kate Bush—she is the Kate Bush of the English Department. Lovely. Wonderful. Somewhat eerie.
Kate Sirluck ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"Was wary after the first few classes as she seemed very opinionated, but quickly changed my mind! Extremely passionate about Shakespeare but is willing to accept any view or opinion as long as you have a solid argument for it. Despite critical feedback on assignments, she marks fairly well depending on the strength of your argument. Great prof!"
Michael O'Hagan ,3.0,3.0,A+,Content of class is the same for every section. The class was mainly him talking bout the french language and its history and then a group in-class exercises for practice that were actually useful but don't count for grade. If you want a good grade you gotta work outside class. Class was boring tho.
Michael O'Hagan ,4.0,2.0,A+,"Professor O'Hagan may seem a little self-important at times, but I honestly don't think that it's that bad, he's just a realistic dude. Honestly, he wants you to do well, and he'll give you every opportunity to get an A if you do the homework (which isn't heavy). He's also very specific about what you need to do, and it isn't that hard."
Michael O'Hagan ,1.0,5.0,N/A,Worst class you'll take at UBC
Michael O'Hagan ,5.0,2.0,N/A,Dr. O'Hagan was such a sweetheart I loved having him as a professor. He could be a little condescending at times but I felt that he really cared about whether or not his students understood his lectures. Definitely would recommend.
Michael O'Hagan ,2.5,5.0,N/A,"Was a B student in French before O'Hagan and now I am barely passing. I think he makes his tests much harder than any previous teachers I have had. Same goes for his compositions, which are very difficult and marks hard on them.    50 % for a final? And at his difficulty? good bye gpa :( Avoid if you can."
Michael O'Hagan ,2.5,3.0,A,"Decent prof, bad guy. 3 Tests: ALL functions, nature of words. Other lessons hardly tested. He likes French & is decently clear, so an A or B is doable. But he's snobby, blunt & unaccommodating.  He lost my test, no apology. Expressed doubt toward my French ability based on previous grades years ago - so unencouraging. Got an A tho. Take that. "
Michael O'Hagan ,2.0,4.0,A,Great prof!
Michael O'Hagan ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"At first, he was intimidating but throughout the course he has gone to show how much passion he has for the subject. He was very helpful when asked and really was very dedicated to the subjects on hand. I truly enjoyed the class and think he is a wonderful character and a great prof!"
Michael O'Hagan ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"Prof. O'Hagan knows the french language, linguistics, and general language history very well.You will get a lot of use of the textbook, and the online site. if you want to achieve high marks in his class, it is not hard but you have to put in the work like all other classes. He can be a little cranky if you approach him before class, but afters ok"
Michael O'Hagan ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Great prof! Very grammar focused, but teaches it well. As a science student, I was worried that it might drop my GPA but my French writing has become much better after attending this class and I have no regrets taking it."
Michael O'Hagan ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Great prof! Explains things perfectly and really puts obvious effort into his lessons.He won't use the textbook you have to buy, but he makes that clear. He does follow the online one. If you are trying to get easy marks, this is not the class for you. He makes sure you deserve your mark, and that is part of why he's such a great prof."
Michael O'Hagan ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"O'Hagan teaches French and its grammar very clearly even for those who don't know grammar in say English. And since his native language is English, he knows where anglophone students are coming from. So he knows when to give a translation for a difficult word, unlike the native french profs. I wish he taught all the french grammar courses."
Michael O'Hagan ,2.0,5.0,N/A,If you do not have prior experience in a French immersion setting do not take O'Hagan's class. His primary focus is grammar. Extremely challenging to do well without a solid foundation in French (above and beyond high-school/college level exposure). Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.
Michael O'Hagan ,2.0,3.0,N/A,Seems like a knowledgeable and passionate man for a French professor but teaches grammar lessons orally with little or no use of visual aid. He also digresses at length about material marginally related to the course. Attendance was not that helpful for test review and independent learning is necessary for success in course.
Michael O'Hagan ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"O'Hagan is a good teacher. I can't say his class was interesting, but that is the fault of the extremely dry course material. He is clear and willing to go over things multiple times. He is a fair marker, as the marks on compositions are calculated mathematically by the number of errors made."
Michael O'Hagan ,3.5,5.0,N/A,"It's obvious that he is passionate about the language, and very familiar with grammar rules. It is tough to ask him questions when you don't understand something though, because he tends to get caught up in the grammatical errors of your question itself, and then get completely sidetracked. Tough marker too, do not take this class for easy marks!"
Michael O'Hagan ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Professor O'Hagan is very detailed, informative, and engaging. I'm pursuing French above the 102 level and I'm hoping to find a lecture he's teaching."
Michael O'Hagan ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"I could tell many in my class didn't enjoy Professor O'Hagan's teaching, but I feel very fortunate to have attended. Maybe his old-fashioned mannerisms make him an awkward teacher, but his instruction was meticulous and interesting. He is definitely the best professor I've ever had."
Michael O'Hagan ,3.0,2.0,N/A,"Kind and respectable man but not exactly the best at teaching :( His English accent is quite noticeable despite his fluency in French, and sometimes it's a bit unclear of what he's talking about. Markwise, he's quite reasonable, I ended up with an A-."
Michael O'Hagan ,3.5,4.0,N/A,Willing to go out of his way to help students understand the material. Passionate about the language. Loud and enthusiastic.
Gail Murphy ,5.0,3.0,N/A,Excellent prof! Well-organized course materials and always helpful
Gail Murphy ,5.0,1.0,N/A,Great prof Always there to help when you need it. Just sent and e-mail and she was always there from me.
Gail Murphy ,4.5,4.0,N/A,Great prof. Course gets tough and confusing sometimes but she's always there for you...
Gail Murphy ,4.5,3.0,N/A,Lecture is slow and boring but prof is clear. Very helpful office hours.
Gail Murphy ,4.0,3.0,A-,"Extremely knowledgeable, spends tons of effort helping students learn, effective in teaching the material (she goes really fast - but I think it's because there's a lot of ground to cover!). Really cool personality and is one of the nicest profs! Office hours helped a lot in gaining understanding/help with the course."
Gail Murphy ,4.0,2.0,N/A,The lectures were clear and she was accessible. There were too many lecture labs for my taste though.
Gail Murphy ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"Dr. Murphy did a fantastic job teaching CPSC 210. It was not an easy course, but she was really good at explaining concepts. Go to her office hours if you're confused about something. She's a total sweetheart and would be more than willing to help you. ABout the class, it's a bit difficult, but doable."
Gail Murphy ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"Best prof ever! She is very patient with her students, she responds very fast to either email or Piazza questions. Also very considerate of her students, one of the nicest profs ever. The tests are reasonable."
Gail Murphy ,5.0,3.0,N/A,Very clear & helpful in understanding material.
Gail Murphy ,5.0,3.0,N/A,Our class was hillarious and she did quite an effective job of teaching the subject. (running dinosaur anyone?)
Gail Murphy ,1.5,4.0,N/A,"Lectures were of little use both for the project and for future. Forget about asking her questions, she'll say things like ""reinstall"", ""try again"", ""check the web""..."

Gail Murphy ,3.0,3.0,N/A,Quite arrogant and confrontational. Wouldn't want to meet her in a back alley...
Gail Murphy ,4.5,2.0,N/A,Great teacher who loves to help her students.
Bob Woodham ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"His notes are terrible and useless. To make matters worse, the textbook he uses is also garbage. Don't take this course if you like to learn on your own."
Bob Woodham ,5.0,3.0,A-,It was his first time teaching this course so he was very careful in teaching it. He was ALWAYS ready to help. Puts a lot of effort into his presentations and tries to help out in any way possible. Very clear. Tries to make the course interesting by giving real life examples and telling stories and taking everything to a higher level. Good prof!
Bob Woodham ,4.5,4.0,A-,Challenging. Exam was fair. Interesting material. I learned a lot.
Bob Woodham ,1.0,3.0,A-,No Comments
Bob Woodham ,2.5,2.0,A-,Snooze fest.
Bob Woodham ,3.0,3.0,A-,Tests fairly but teaches way beyond the students' level
Joel Feldman ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Professor Feldman is absolutely brilliant and cares a lot about his students. His lectures are fun and he goes through each problem slowly step by step, so it's very easy to follow. He is super approachable and helpful in office hours, welcomes anyone, and after you'd magically understand everything. He prepares his students well for the final!"
Joel Feldman ,5.0,4.0,N/A,He is a rockstar. Too bad he is retiring. Assignments were very hard and the exam was not easy either. Such a great teacher - this course was a great challenge.
Joel Feldman ,5.0,5.0,B-,"Amazing lecturer! Goes through material slowly and carefully, I found him to be super clear. His notes are great too. Assignments are very, very intense and exams are pretty difficult. Joel is incredibly helpful in office hours, definitely seek help there. I didn't get a good grade but I learnt a lot, would take again! He made 321 fun."
Joel Feldman ,3.0,3.0,N/A,Very clear and thorough professor but his notes are straight out of the textbook. You should expect that all the examples done in class  match the CLP notes exactly.
Joel Feldman ,5.0,2.0,A,Just.... Perfect!
Joel Feldman ,5.0,3.0,N/A,Crystal clear lecturer who is especially helpful during office hours.
Joel Feldman ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"Hands down the most caring prof I have ever met. Unlimited office hours, as long as he is at UBC, his door will be open, and whenever his door is open, you can feel free to go in and chat. "
Joel Feldman ,5.0,3.0,A,"Great, professor, his exams may be a bit difficult if you don't put enough work into preparing for them. His notes are excellent and very useful, if you work all the way through them. I did better in Integral than I did in Differential just because of how good this class was with him."
Joel Feldman ,5.0,3.0,N/A,Extremely qualified and brilliant mathematician and prof. I cannot sing enough praises for Feldman. His lectures thoroughly cover the material and his notes are extremely useful. Quizzes and exams are reasonable based on material content but not necessarily easy. Always available for office hours and questions.
Joel Feldman ,4.5,2.0,N/A,Brilliant mind. His in class quizzes are really hard. His lectures don't stand out and his online notes are superfluous when you have the textbook. But he is a GOD when you visit him during office hours. He explains questions perfectly with the perfect number of steps that'll give you epiphanies everytime. He just gets your confusions and problems.
Joel Feldman ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"Absolute best prof I've had. Explains everything clearly and rarely needs to explain himself twice. If needed, he will help you understand whatever you need during his office hours. Brilliant."
Joel Feldman ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"His note and the way he teaches is very clear, but the assignment and exams are pretty hard. Expect scaling at the end"
Joel Feldman ,5.0,2.0,N/A,Super nice proff
Joel Feldman ,2.0,3.0,N/A,If you don't have a pre-understanding of the material there's a good chance you'd be lost.
Joel Feldman ,5.0,2.0,N/A,He is soo h0t
Joel Feldman ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"I am fron economics background and took two of his courses, Math 320 and 321. He's one of the three best professors I've ever had. I even spent one night to write a letter to norminate him for the Killam teaching award. Later I found out he had already won one. If he's teaching and the course is related to your field, you should definitely take it."
Joel Feldman ,4.0,5.0,N/A,9 A's and one F bomb on my report card the year I took Math 320.  Tricky stuff.
Joel Feldman ,4.5,1.0,N/A,"Makes a hard course easy. if he teaches, you should seriously consider taking Math 321."
Joel Feldman ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"The best math professor I've ever had.  He is very clear, thorough, and helpful.  He expects a lot, but he also teaches extremely well, so I think he's entitled.  He definitely knows his stuff, and I think you'd be hard pressed to find math that he doesn't know.  I'm pretty sure that if Chuck Norris taught math, he'd be Joel Feldman."
Joel Feldman ,5.0,2.0,N/A,he's the best math prof i have ever had!! he's freaking good!!! i heard he graduated from MIT. he's super clear in class. he talks very clearly and calmly. and his notes are extremely useful and clear!! hard to find a prof better than him!!!  you definitely should take his courses.
Rebecca Raglon ,2.0,5.0,N/A,Exam was very difficult. Final essay assignment needs to be very well written to get even close to a 70 percent.
Rebecca Raglon ,4.0,2.0,N/A,"Not the most exciting class ever, but if you just need to make it through 112 she's the prof for you. She marks pretty easy, is pretty chill, and I actually learned some stuff about English during the course. Make sure you come to class. -A first-year engineer"
Rebecca Raglon ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Really great classes, she makes english 112 really interesting and engaging."
Rebecca Raglon ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"Overall, she was great. Her readings weren't too outrageous, mostly found online. Had a variety of ways to get marks. Pretty understanding + kind, doesn't hold your hand but doesn't leave you compeletly stranded either. Need to be a good listener, one of those profs where she says things once and you're expected to remember."
Rebecca Raglon ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"First english lit class I've ever enjoyed or felt like I actually had something to contribute to. The readings were great, not excessive, and mostly online for free. I'm looking to take more classes with her in the future."
Rebecca Raglon ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"She was great and really helpful. Sometimes the lectures were dull, but that was mainly because of the refusal for anyone in the class to participate."
Rebecca Raglon ,3.0,3.0,N/A,"Sometimes hard to approach, if you show that you are engaged in class and participate, she will reciprocate that in her demeanor and your grades."
Rebecca Raglon ,4.0,1.0,N/A,"She is a good teacher, she encourages participation and seems to mark relatively easily. This is an English course after all not rocket science. I'd take another course with her if it came up."
Rebecca Raglon ,2.5,3.0,N/A,"frankly rude. showed up to first class when I asked a question, she answered as if I didn't even know english treated me like i was in grade 2."
Rebecca Raglon ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"Personally, I found her very approachable and friendly. She'll really help you out if you show her that you're interested. Marking is tough but fair. Try to come to EVERY class because lots of things happen every lesson!"
Rebecca Raglon ,2.5,3.0,N/A,it's okay..
Rebecca Raglon ,1.5,4.0,N/A,"shuts down students, can be very dismissive. rude."
Rebecca Raglon ,1.5,3.0,N/A,separated me and my friend like a grade 4 teacher would. Constantly shuts down the personal opinions of students.
Rebecca Raglon ,2.5,4.0,N/A,"Quizzes and related readings unrelated to university writing.  Insulted me in class.  Prior to attending this class I enjoyed english, going through it now I hardly enjoy it."
Rebecca Raglon ,2.0,4.0,N/A,"Nice person, useful comment about writing assignment. but super boring... Lots of reading and writing... Mostly unrelated to how to write a good essay. ""Mini"" quiz is super long and not straight forward."
Rebecca Raglon ,4.0,1.0,N/A,Easy marker
Rebecca Raglon ,5.0,3.0,N/A,Very intelligent woman. Gives thoughtful and interesting insights. My only complaint are the other students in the class who seem to be stuck in high-school mode. Not everything is going to be handed to you on a plate.

Dharma Wijewickreme ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"Explains things clearly. Passionate about subject, wants students to do well. Pace can be a bit slow but if you show up and participate in the course you won't be left behind."
Dharma Wijewickreme ,5.0,2.0,A,Interesting class. Cares about the students doing well.
Dharma Wijewickreme ,3.5,1.0,A,"An easy class taught by a decent professor, you should easily be getting 80+ as long as you show up to every class and do the ""assignments"" (problem sets that aren't collector nor worth any marks, but are very similar to quizzes and finals)."
Dharma Wijewickreme ,1.5,3.0,N/A,Out of all the profs I have had at UBC Wijewicki seems to care about students the least. He doesn't give midterms back nor does he let you even see them. One of the worst profs I've had
Dharma Wijewickreme ,3.5,1.0,N/A,"Lectures can be a bit boring at times, but they are super clear if yo can stay awake. Very consistent, careful lecture style. He always asks for feedback with iclicker quizzes, and makes adjustments based on the results. He really cares that everyone understands, and tries to get the class involved in the lectures. Great Prof."
Dharma Wijewickreme ,3.5,3.0,N/A,"He's a very nice instructor. So considerate of students. His notes are not easy to follow, but the book for this class is awesome. Overall, a useful class."
Dharma Wijewickreme ,4.5,2.0,N/A,Gives good marks for the exam... lot of details which are relevant...very approachable
Dharma Wijewickreme ,1.5,3.0,N/A,"Very boring class, teahcer is hard to understand.  Says too many words than need to be said and ends up confusing people.  Also cuts off half way through something important to summarize something we all knew already (seems as though he totally losses the point of his argument)."
Dharma Wijewickreme ,2.0,3.0,N/A,"His notes are harder to follow than his name is to say.  Abysmal notes, long tedious assignments, very boring lectures.  He emphasizes everything he says making it very difficult to understand the main points of the lecture.  The class does not follow the textbook by any means, formulas and variables are different."
Dharma Wijewickreme ,1.5,3.0,N/A,"Very boring lectures. All the notes are in powerpoint, so there is very little reason to follow along. The few examples done in class don't always help for the assignments and the text book doesn't always follow the theory presented in class. Overall, I am quite unhappy with this course, and don't feel like I have been taught anything relevant."
Dharma Wijewickreme ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Dharma is a fantastic teacher.  He is very passionate, and approachable.  I dont know why the other ratings are so bad, perhaps they are civl engineers....and not the rocking geo engineers. His notes are great, and he really seems to put alot of work into his lectures, and cares how his students are doing."
Dharma Wijewickreme ,1.0,5.0,N/A,Lazy professor who would rather not be there. Very boring!
Dharma Wijewickreme ,2.0,1.0,N/A,"if you can manage to stay awake in his class, im sure its good...but i'm just guessing...bring a pillow so your arm doesnt fall asleep"
Dharma Wijewickreme ,2.0,3.0,N/A,Doesn't put in much effort.  Very boring.  No matter how much I try I can't pay attention or stay awake.
Dharma Wijewickreme ,2.5,3.0,A,"In plain word, one of the most unhelpful, uncurtious and lack of people skills instructors I've had. His teaching methods are wrong - doesn't return midterms so you cannot see what you did wrong, doesn't post assignments, takes a year to mark an assignment, and dosen't believe students about anything. If you can, avoid him!"
Dharma Wijewickreme ,3.5,3.0,A,Decent Teacher... very approachable... but the way he presents his material is very boring.. I find it hard to stay awake in class. He could do some more practicial examples and less derivation...... I do find the textbook (Coduto) extremly useful.
Dharma Wijewickreme ,5.0,1.0,A,This prof. did a wonderful job on teaching.  He knows his lecture materials well and provides lots of practical/real world examples.
Dharma Wijewickreme ,5.0,2.0,A,"Excellent in all aspects; clear, helpful, nice, knowledgeable, reasonable, available. No problems whatsoever."

Geoffrey Hall ,5.0,4.0,A+,"PLEASE TAKE A CLASS WITH HIM! He is sooooo kind and always available for office hours - he is one of the world's best psychologists so make use of that and get to know him, despite his knowledge and achievements he is so grounded (also he went to Harvard). Stats is not easy but he explains the basics really well, strong foundation - I got a 92!"
Geoffrey Hall ,5.0,2.0,A+,"It's difficult to make stats sounds interesting - but Dr. Hall does it 100%. He is always enthusiastic, prepared and explains concepts to you like you're a bunch of monkeys, with lots of repetition so that you will definitely get it. Do all the Coglabs before class starts. Very fair exams: two midterms + a final. Recommend office hours."
Geoffrey Hall ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"Absolutely useless when it came to actually transferring the knowledge to us. The lectures sound like he is talking to a 1st grader, and the exams are not what you are taught. loss of money, time and your mental health. It is ironic that ""psych"" is supposed to care about students' mental health, yet it is the most bogus material. Good luck!"
Geoffrey Hall ,3.0,5.0,N/A,"Thought he was a tough teacher, would recommend taking 218 with someone else. Thought the tests were really hard. Was a nice guy, but the lectures were the most boring things I have ever had to sit through"
Geoffrey Hall ,5.0,2.0,N/A,Professor Hall is truly the best professor I have ever had at UBC. His lectures are insanely clear and easy to grasp all while making the class as interesting as possible. The labs aren't difficult and the exams are very fair.
Geoffrey Hall ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"Dr Hall is just great. He is kind, humble, and encouraging. Very experienced and knowledgeable. Be sure to complete all the assignments and do the practices in the textbook and A is coming your way. Goes extra miles to help his students. He holds office hours and exam reviews, thought he could be  busy/occupied at times as the department head."
Geoffrey Hall ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"Dr. Hall manages to make stats interesting somehow. Actually enjoy going to class because of it.  Midterms can be very tricky,  and classes are no breeze but if you keep up with material  Dr. Hall makes it much more clear.  Organized and enthusiastic about what he teaches take psyc218 with Hall if you can . Incredibly helpful and approachable ! :)"
Geoffrey Hall ,4.0,2.0,A+,"Dr. Hall is a nice prof. Tests are difficult, but they're scaled up. We have to take stats, so take it with Hall."
Geoffrey Hall ,5.0,3.0,A,"I love Professor Hall's enthusiasm. It is clear that he truly cares about his students and is quite passionate about what he teaches. You can see it from the way he teaches. He makes stats really easy to understand. Exams were fair if you read the textbook and go to lectures, lovely teacher. Recommend! And he looks like Aria's Dad from PPL."
Geoffrey Hall ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Extremely dedicated professor who truly cares about his students' learning experience. Moderates just about every single post on Vista. Approachable, fair, and doesn't stuck up like many others in the department. Teaching style was clear, effecive, and organised. Watch out for his True/False exam questions though."
Geoffrey Hall ,5.0,3.0,N/A,The MOST AMAZING prof ever. Who would have thought university statistics would have been a GPA booster!! He was so fair and so nice and most importantly brought the driest dullest material one could imagine into life and made it FUN. Exams were fair and he held thorough review sessions beforehand solving questions. Unforgettable experience.
Geoffrey Hall ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"very clear in teaching. the textbook is quite expensive but it is very useful. course itself is not hard at all with a bit of effort. 30 people got perfect on one of the midterms. Take 218 with him, u won't regret it."
Geoffrey Hall ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"One of my favourite professors at UBC. I did not want to take statistics at all before this class and now I actually think it's decent. His midterms are kind of tough but he sets up review sessions before each one and is really approachable & helpful. Definitely take stats with him, you'll enjoy it!"
Geoffrey Hall ,4.0,2.0,N/A,"The best prof I've ever had in UBC :) the material is very boring but the classes weren't boring at all. He is very helpful, enthusiastic prof and he has taught this course for more than 15 years. Great prof. If you're going to take this course, take Dr.Hall's class!!!"
Geoffrey Hall ,5.0,3.0,N/A,An incredibly wonderful professor that truly cares about his students. His teaching is extremely clear and very organized. He makes Stats actually fun and interesting. He also goes the extra mile by kindly organizing review sessions before midterms. Very approachable as well. Definitely take psych 218 with him! He's simply 100% awesome!
Geoffrey Hall ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"Extremely helpful professor, you won't want to take it with anyone else. Assignments are very easy although sometimes tricky. He makes things REALLY clear but he will bore you to hell if you know the concepts already. Overall an excellent professor. I excel this course although I don't quite like statistics"
Geoffrey Hall ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"The best prof I ever had. He is extremely helpful when you have problems. He hold extra office hours before midterms and finals, and he even monitors the discussion board. Assignments are easy and straightforward if you pay attention to the questions. I hate stat but I enjoy this course."
Geoffrey Hall ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"Great prof with lots of energy. Really clear & well-paced lectures. He has review sessions before every exam for last minute questions and creates extra problem sets too. A word of warning: assignments often have trick questions! Read the text, do practice problems, and you will succeed."
Geoffrey Hall ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"You dont wanna take this class with any other prof besides Dr. Hall. Hes upbeat, suuper helpful and even got me liking stats by the end of it. No doubt this course involves lotsa work no matter which section ur in, but if u attend his lectures + understand the text the exams shouldnt b a shock. I failed first yr calc but finished this cls w/ a 79!"
Geoffrey Hall ,5.0,1.0,N/A,very organised proff. his notes are so clear and Dr Hall is an awesome proff. definitely recommend him.
Ira Nadel ,5.0,3.0,A,Wonderful prof. !
Ira Nadel ,1.0,4.0,N/A,"His whole course setting was deeply offensive with 100% of the readings written by white authors and 80%+ of them male (It was an American literature class!). He made me, as well as the whole class as I could tell, very uncomfortable with the way he talked about fascism in an almost endorsing way. I just wonder how to report that to ubc."
Ira Nadel ,3.0,3.0,B,"Strictly enforces no technology during lectures, will take your phone away if he catches you using it. Shows interest in the books he picks and analyses during lectures but you still need to read to get a good grade. Lets you bring a copy of your book for in class essays."
Ira Nadel ,2.0,5.0,B,Nadel obviously knows what he's talking about and is very passionate but his lectures put me to sleep. There is no criteria for papers so the grading is very subjective. Worst mark I've received to date as a student.
Ira Nadel ,1.0,4.0,A,"Dr. Nadel did not create a respectful learning environment. On one occasion, Dr. Nadel confiscated a phone, became irate, and told the class to leave 30 minutes early. His insights into the novels are mediocre. His lectures are dull, with minimal use of visual aids. Ineffective, as 80% of learning is visual. ENGL110's saving grace was the TAs."
Ira Nadel ,4.0,4.0,N/A,"Dr. Nadel has very interesting insights into spy literature, its themes and wider social commentaries. If you have a chance, take the course--the reading list is excellent, especially the Conrad novels. Lecture can start to feel a little mentally overloaded at times, because Ira talks nonstop and will hit you with an unending stream of points."
Ira Nadel ,4.0,3.0,A-,"I really liked Prof. Nadel! As an instructor, he's curious and keen, a long-winded talker (which is good for the occasional rant), enthusiastic about the material and just generally a nice person. I didn't like the reading material (not into Russian lit- sorry!) but still really enjoyed his class. Fair assignments, fair marker, not too difficult."
Ira Nadel ,4.0,4.0,N/A,"His lectures are pretty chaotic but still super engaging, he pretty much just gives his insights into whatever topic he deems he's interested in that day. You'll need to study a lot on your own for midterms and papers. For his term papers he gives suggested topics and half of them are on works assigned and lectured on only after the paper's due."
Ira Nadel ,4.0,4.0,A-,"Don't be afraid of straight up & down. Malicious sneaks beware! Secretariat on the lookout for American Pharoahs. This life is tricky-- beware. Reading intensive-- just do it! If you think you're ducking into the Louvre to remove a few valuables and be gone you are going to be most sad. Aforementioned, man, Doctor, Professor here to crack the whip."
Ira Nadel ,5.0,3.0,A,"Ira's lectures are more a series of insights and interpretations than straight-forward guides. This approach worked well for me because I like to do my own thing on papers, but I can definitely understand that it could be difficult for others. If you want exceptionally interesting lectures that feel more like a good novel than a class, he's it."
Ira Nadel ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Nadel is a world-class prof. He's intimidating but in a way that makes you want to do your best work. Not too tough a marker and appreciates a creative approach. His lectures are pretty brilliant but thorough and clear, so that you never feel lost or unable to approach the poems in your own writing. He's also hilarious, and a compassionate guy."
Ira Nadel ,4.0,4.0,A-,Nadel is a great seminar instructor. He asks thought-provoking questions and provides valuable insight we otherwise wouldn't have had access to. He clearly knows his stuff.
Ira Nadel ,4.0,5.0,B-,"His lectures are indeed interesting, entertaining, and inspirational. It makes you think a lot. But that also backfires making his words ambiguous, and it's next to impossible figuring out what he wants to see in the essays and papers. He requests something original, but if you give him your original, you also have to say goodbye to your grade."
Ira Nadel ,1.0,3.0,N/A,"Prof Nadel starts lecture by writing ambiguous, barely legible words on the board, barely clarifies, talks about things of little to no relevance. He is very hard to listen to as you never really know where he is going with any thought. Little to no lecture structure, and admits he makes up some of his lectures on the drive to school. worst."
Ira Nadel ,4.0,4.0,N/A,"Inspiring prof who is dedicated to excelling in his field.  Grades you on how well you argue your points for papers. Don't add fluff--he'll know. Extra marks for creativity. It may not seem like it at first, but he genuinely cares about us students--he even brought cookies to the last day of classes (enough said)"
Ira Nadel ,3.0,4.0,B+,"Nadel picked several interesting books & several  extremely boring books. There also didn't seem to be one theme which wove through the whole course- it was rather disjointed. As well, it seemed that he'd read all the books, but not recently. He kept getting details wrong. His exams are difficult, but doable as long as you paid attention in class."
Ira Nadel ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"Great professor. Had a bad beginning of term and he was challenging, engaged, and extremely helpful. Brilliant individual, amazing lectures. Would highly recommend his course to any literature major."
Ira Nadel ,3.5,3.0,A-,"Great lectures. Basically does a one hour long story. Not a lot of discussion in class with students. Regarding midterms, I'd recommend you take the 1.5 hour sections if you can. An hour for an essay question is not a lot of time."
Ira Nadel ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"I actually found his ""obsessions"" (fog, newspapers, colors, city) really interesting as they made me read novels in a new way. His class improved my close reading skills and he was a fantastic prof who seemed to really care for student learning. Answers emails quickly and  helpful during office hours!"
Ira Nadel ,3.0,3.0,A-,"Heard good things about him from Professor Sirluck (the queen of ENGL) and was utterly disappointed. Don't waste your time -- 19th cen. lit is my favorite genre to study and he almost ruined it for me. NOT A STIMULATING CLASS. He has topics he obsesses about (fog, colors, newspapers), and doesn't encourage creative thinking. Boring proff."
Dale Rolfsen ,2.5,5.0,N/A,"Okay... I actually thought he was SO friendly and approachable. BUT! I agree with everyone here, when it comes to teaching, he is useless. He didnt write the exams, but they had nothing to do with what we learned, so he didnt prepare anyone. I only got an A because the final grades were scaled a loooot."
Dale Rolfsen ,3.0,4.0,N/A,"txt oriented; goes over same ex. as in txt (helps in hwk). Notes are usually clear. Walks back and forth frequently. Boring classes usually, and u don't need to go to class. I used memory from high skol calc to get through.Questions on the MT are hard,diagrams given make more confusing.Avg MT1:45% MT2:58%. Will scale after final (not taken yet)."
Dale Rolfsen ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"Worst math prof ever! do not take this class thinking it will help towards med school, it will not! the average for our midterms was 45%. He has no clue how to teach. When u go to his class all he does is copy the exact examples from the textbook (online, cant buy). The problem sets have no comparison to exams. Exams are ridiculously hard. Take 105"
Dale Rolfsen ,4.0,5.0,N/A,"Rolfsen... What a guy. Really nice, and really helpful in office hours, but if you want to make a horrible life decision sign up for his class at 8am. He likely has the most boring voice ever. Exams are ridiculously hard too, but he follows the textbook almost exactly."
Dale Rolfsen ,2.5,5.0,N/A,He basically just repeats the same examples that are given in the text.  You could easily skip the lectures and just read the book.  His lectures are useless...
Dale Rolfsen ,3.5,2.0,N/A,He uses most of his examples from the text but explains them clearly. Since I transfered sections to get away from a horrible prof he was like a savior to me >.>
Dale Rolfsen ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"Pretty decent prof. Midterms and final exam were both not too hard, but not easy either. As long as you do the suggested homework, read the materials b4 going to lecture, and prepare for his weekly quizzes, you'll definitely ace the course. I really liked his class. A tip for studying for mts and final: Buy math club's exam booklets and do them!"
Dale Rolfsen ,2.0,4.0,N/A,Disregard for the medical health of students. Should back up what his website says in regards to being compassionate. Not compassionate at all!
Dale Rolfsen ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"He is very kind & caring of his students. Very helpful during office hours. Not sure if he teaches great, but he surely does what his students want, like cutting down the # of hw questions and postponing quizzes during exam week."
Dale Rolfsen ,2.5,3.0,N/A,"He's just a poor voice recording of the textbook; he repeats examples from the book, adds in mistakes, but leave out the important points.  His midterms are very inconsistant; the class average for the 1st midterm was 68%, while the 2nd one dropped to 40%."
Dale Rolfsen ,1.0,5.0,N/A,I hate him!!!!!!!!!  Very annoying person.  Doesn't know how to teach.  Inconsiderate of students.  He sux!
Dale Rolfsen ,3.5,3.0,N/A,"He's a cute teddy bear of a man, but he can go from clear to outer space in one lecture. Still, seems like a really nice guy. Interesting braid research"

Dale Rolfsen ,2.0,3.0,N/A,"he is not a good prof! ... he doent care whether you understand the materials or not even in the office hours, but the book is the best guide ( math 253) ... you ll get everything from book  ( no need to attend class!)"
Dale Rolfsen ,1.0,5.0,N/A,Gosh I hate him.  Very inconsiderate of students.  So unhelpful.
Dale Rolfsen ,2.0,1.0,N/A,"If you want a good mark, take his class.  All quizzes/exams are straight from the notes.  He is not a good lecturer, though.  Frequently makes mistakes in his examples and often seems confused by the course he is teaching.  However, he is a very nice man.  Made cookies for the class and gave out candy canes before the final exam!"
Dale Rolfsen ,2.0,3.0,N/A,I dun like him.  So inconsiderate of students
Dale Rolfsen ,5.0,3.0,N/A,great
Dale Rolfsen ,3.0,3.0,N/A,He is okay...the final is hard..the homework is a lot..okay useful lecture notes

Hung-Sia Teh ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"Notes are good. Doesn't like to answer questions. In fact, even ridicules you for asking questions"
Hung-Sia Teh ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"Had him for the Immunology section of Micb 202. He covered the material pretty well - his lectures complemented the course notes for the course and makes them more student friendly in my opinion. He answers questions before/after class and is extremely helpful. The exams for this course, however, were all multiple choice."
Hung-Sia Teh ,3.0,4.0,N/A,"A really nice fellow. Class is well-paced and easy to follow. However, this class isn't easy. LOTS to memorize and you must memorize it all!"
Hung-Sia Teh ,4.0,1.0,N/A,"Dr. Teh made everything very clear in my opinion (the supplemental notes are great), and his final was incredibly straight forward. Didn't need to use the textbook even once. His lectures are boring, as he just reads through his notes (verbatim), but the way he lays out concepts and figures makes them easy to understand."
Hung-Sia Teh ,1.0,4.0,N/A,"he was difficult to understand, boring, he read completely off his notes, and required too much memorization."
Hung-Sia Teh ,1.5,4.0,N/A,"difficult to understand what he says. his lecture slides are the exact same as the packaged course notes and so he just reads off of them. the midterm was much harder than the practice midterm. MC questions were vague and were along the lines of ""i/ii are correct, i/iii are correct, all of the above, and none of the above""."
Hung-Sia Teh ,1.5,4.0,N/A,"Bad prof for a not-so-bad course. Very knowledgeable, but fairly incomprehensible voice & accent, need extreme concentration. Huge posted notes, need lots of time to organize and take it all in, which you MUST do before the brutal Finals. Questions answered alright."
Hung-Sia Teh ,3.5,4.0,N/A,"Final was okay, no tricks, just requires you to memorize everything. Make sure you know the names and the functions of the interferons, cytokines, chemokines, and the integrins. I suggest using a seperate note to keep track of them. There were a few thinking questions that don't relate to specific sections. Say all the things that you can think of."
Hung-Sia Teh ,3.5,4.0,N/A,Nice fellow but his accent makes him hard to follow. I used the text book extensively for his section. FT was fair but many didn't think so. Spends too much time trying to answer everyone's questions and doesn't help on the forums like Gold did. Notes are okay but not great. Lecture is pretty bland. Ppl said tutorial was pretty good. I didn't go.
Hung-Sia Teh ,2.5,5.0,N/A,"Dr. Teh was a little hard to understand.   The actual class notes package was wel organized, though"
Hung-Sia Teh ,4.0,2.0,N/A,"Not a bad professor and knowledgeable by all means. Says 'okay' and 'right' alot after his sentences, which can get annoying.  Some midterm questions can be vague.  I hate it when he lets students ask questions on forever though; that's what office hours are for."
Hung-Sia Teh ,2.0,4.0,N/A,"sooo boring, you look around and see half the class doing the morning crossword instead."
Hung-Sia Teh ,3.5,4.0,A,"He is extremely knowledgeable in his field, and very receptive to questions. He makes an effort to help students too.  The only problem is, its hard to understand him and follow his lectures.  His notes are not as detailed as one would hope, but they get the point across."
Hung-Sia Teh ,1.0,5.0,A,his notes are worthless and he cant teach. dr gold is much better
Hung-Sia Teh ,2.5,3.0,A,"Not as bad as some people make him out to be. Yes, he is a little monotone and queit when speaking but he is very responsive to questions and has fairly clear notes. The only downfall is that he uses his own research to teach, which can be a bit too in depth in terms of detail for a 3rd year undergrad."

Hung-Sia Teh ,4.0,4.0,A,"the immunology part of MICB202 is HARD!!! way harder than the other 2 parts. His midterm was pretty hard, I got a 60ish mark. So study your ass off, but the Micb202 final was very easy!!!! My final mark was A- in the end, thanks to the final!!!! Btw, there is NO SCALING for this course...!"
Hung-Sia Teh ,1.5,5.0,A,"pros: nice, acceptable pace, provides explanations where needed
 
 cons: accent too prevalent, trails off, inefficient professor, writing incorporates unintellegible symbols, luddite, tardy"
Hung-Sia Teh ,2.5,3.0,A,He tries really hard but he's sometimes hard to understand. He has trouble interpreting student questions so it's best not to ask. His powerpoint presentation is the same as the notes and he goes on to re-copy the whole powerpoint onto the overhead... waste of time in my opinion.
Hung-Sia Teh ,4.0,4.0,A,he's Okay
Alan Wagner ,3.0,4.0,N/A,"Teaching style gets a little while to get used to. Make sure to understand everything on his slides! Course content is a lot, but his tests will reuse a lot of questions from practice exams. 3 coding assignments, 3 midterms, and final. Make sure you have a good partner!"
Alan Wagner ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Great prof in terms of keeping you engaged. He can sometimes get a little confused in class but that's the charm. He conducts most of the tutorials himself and all in all if you put in the work and make an effort to understand the material, you'll enjoy this class with him. He's always willing to answer questions"
Alan Wagner ,4.0,4.0,N/A,He's a good prof for CPSC 317
Alan Wagner ,4.0,3.0,B,"Really engaged prof, especially considering that most of the tutorials were personally led by him as well, and they really help you review the materials. The lecture slides are pretty bare bone so if you skip class, then you will have to make up for it by going through the textbook. Overall, it was an enjoyable experience taking 317 with him."
Alan Wagner ,4.0,3.0,N/A,Not sure why so many awful reviews but honestly his lectures aren't too bad. Quizzes are fair. Assignments are difficult and long but there is enough time given to complete them. He's a pretty average lecturer
Alan Wagner ,5.0,3.0,A-,"Extremely nice, and knows what he's talking about. Some people find his lectures confusing, but I like them. Overall a great course."
Alan Wagner ,5.0,3.0,A,"An excellent course, I really really enjoyed taking CPSC317 with him. Ignore that silly reddit post about CPSC 317."
Alan Wagner ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"I really enjoyed CPSC 317 with Dr. Wagner, and I liked that he taught the tutorials himself. If you read the textbook and attend class, you'll do fine in the course."
Alan Wagner ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"(I had him for CPSC 317 but it wasn't listed as an option here). Dr. Wagner has not only been an amazing prof, he has been very kind and accommodating. If you actually go to class and show him that you care about the subject matter then you'll do fine. He's a very smart guy who cares a lot about the subject matter and about students."
Alan Wagner ,1.0,4.0,N/A,"Lectures aren't as bad as some people make it out to be. Questions on quizzes aren't excessively difficult, but the quizzes are long. However, the assignments are insanely difficult."
Alan Wagner ,1.0,3.0,N/A,"I'm a bit of an outlier in that I don't find Wagner's lecturing that horrible, but I despise is his quizzes(which you will have 3 of throughout the term and are 7-10 pages long to be done in 50 minutes) have a lot of points dedicated to something he mentions VERY VERY briefly in class and is not in the textbook or lecture slides, unacceptable."
Alan Wagner ,1.0,4.0,A-,"Avoid him if possible. Lectures aren't clear, minimum useful info on the slides. Confusing lectures. Be prepared to read textbooks and self-study, or ask TA for help. Assignments aren't easy, and not quite relevant to lecture contents."
Alan Wagner ,2.0,4.0,A-,"CPSC 317 is a tough course & unfortunately, there are not many good profs that teach this course. Alan certainly did not help. You Need to HEAVILY rely on the textbook as lectures are not useful (lectures were always half empty). Assignments are super tough so find a good partner One good thing Alan did was always give clear learning goals."
Alan Wagner ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"Extremely bad professor and can't seem to explain very basic concepts well, his thoughts wonders all over the place and constantly make mistakes in the lecture, unless some students catch the mistake, good luck, he will never correct himself. Went to his office hour for help on the assignment and he doesn't know a single thing about his assignments"
Alan Wagner ,1.0,4.0,A,"Not an effective communicator during lectures, will go off on tangents that are irrelevant to the material. Quizzes are worded strangely. Also very little practice material provided. Forgot his own review session and a student had to call him and tell him where it was LOL"
Alan Wagner ,1.0,4.0,C+,"Wagner tends to go on tangents for the majority of the class and is incapable of articulating the information on the slides. Add to that difficult assignments and extremely unhelpful slides (messy, surface-level, and non-covering) - there's a clear reason why basically no one attends his lectures any more. He's trying, but he's just not a good prof"
Alan Wagner ,1.0,4.0,N/A,"Definitely the worst CPSC experience I have had at UBC.  He was never prepared for lectures, and would go on confusing tangents. I left most classes having no idea what he was talking about, and basically had to teach everything to myself. I will definitely avoid taking another class with Dr. Wagner."
Alan Wagner ,1.0,4.0,N/A,"In all 4 years of UBC, I haven't taken a worse class. He makes little to no sense, rambles on about things that aren't applicable, and talks himself in circles. I wish I read the ratings here before I signed up, as they're pretty telling."
Alan Wagner ,1.5,4.0,N/A,"Nice enough guy, but what a scatterbrain. Impossible to follow, goes off on tangents and gets himself turned around in class. His notes are useless and I found myself finding outside material just to understand the concepts. Did not give a date for the midterm until very far into the term. Changed grading schemes partway through the course. Ugh :("
Alan Wagner ,1.5,4.0,N/A,Very useless teacher. Just read the textbook. He was no help at all with the assignments. But the good thing about him was that he took the class' input about not making the format of the final like the midterms(very long and hard) into consideration . The TA's in this course were extremely helpful. Take advantage of the learning center hours.
Frank Tester ,4.5,3.0,A-,good class. prof tried to get some discussion going in a class of 60 students. some students not comfortable expressing opinions and revealing their values but he dealt with it well. did his best to allow for small group work. don't think he was treated fairly by some of the students.

Frank Tester ,1.5,3.0,N/A,This man is so condescending and disrespectful.  He's nice-- until you challenge him. Then it's a different story.  Watch out.
Frank Tester ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"you know, this guy's course and some of the things he said are the only things i really remember well about my social work education 2 years later, but at the time i wondered if the stuff was even relevant"

Frank Tester ,2.0,3.0,N/A,Frank is anti - anti everything and has some very strong biases that prevent his teaching from being objective and critical. Some of his teachings are quite flawed and he is not able to answer many questions asked by students.
Boris Gorzalka ,5.0,1.0,A-,"best prof I have ever had in my life, unfortunately he has retired from teaching so I guess I'll be the last person to rate him here."
Boris Gorzalka ,5.0,4.0,A+,He has so much information about psychology and he is a very good lecturer that motivates you to listen to his lectures. You should study hard for his exams. I would recommend him to poeple who love psychology
Boris Gorzalka ,4.5,3.0,A-,"The most interesting prof I had for the first year, very knowledgeable and interested in his research, he's the head of the psych department and conducts most researches. His tests are tricky, attendance is  required but there is no participation mark. He is super helpful as his course lasts 2 hours plus a 30 mins to ask for questions."
Boris Gorzalka ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"His lectures were quite interesting and clear, but he didn't go over a lot of things in class that were in the textbook. There was only 1 midterm and 1 final and it was 50/50 on lectures and textbook so it's not too hard to get a good grade. There is a fair bit of memorization on lecture material though."
Boris Gorzalka ,5.0,2.0,N/A,Great Prof!!!
Boris Gorzalka ,3.0,4.0,N/A,"In my opinion, i was very bored in every class. I began with great enthusiasm, I even wanna major in psyc. I was really disappointed with what we were learning. super dry nonsense boring stuff. He uses ONLY chalk, no technology. He didn't lecture enough on hard topics: neuro, stats, learning. and tested on it by the textbook. more bio than psyc."
Boris Gorzalka ,2.5,2.0,N/A,"Guy is pretty boring so if interested in psychology, definitely avoid. Only good thing about the class was that he had 1 midterm and 1 final with both being multiple choice. Not terribly difficult to get a 75+ average so if your looking at grades not bad guy i guess but again he makes a very interesting subject feel like torture."
Boris Gorzalka ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Extremely entertaining professor, lectures are pretty much all mandatory. Exams are fairly difficult and require studying from the textbook and lectures (50/50). Overall, he made the course very fun and enjoyable."
Boris Gorzalka ,5.0,4.0,N/A,Made the lectures so interesting and worth while that it was almost a shame to miss a lecture. Take good notes both during lectures and from the text. Midterms are tricky. TA's: the nicest people but the worst markers. They take you down for the smallest of things.
Boris Gorzalka ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"very very nice man,but exams are bit hard..."
Boris Gorzalka ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"Some people find him monontonous, but honestly the stories he has and the topics he teaches are so interesting. We learned about phedofiles the first day! He definately got me interested in PSYCH. However, the midterms require a lot of studying, don't study a day before, won't work!"
Boris Gorzalka ,3.5,3.0,N/A,"Professor Gorzalka is a great lecturer. He sometimes goes through things a little quickly, so make sure you are awake, and sitting near enough to see the blackboard. The whole year is multiple choice (4 midterms, 1 final) so read the textbook and your lecture notes to succeed. Midterms are not unreasonable, but the final was quite tricky."
Boris Gorzalka ,1.5,4.0,N/A,Really into himself. Relates material to personal stories (can you say 'ego trip'?) but the tests are strictly from text. Paper marking seemed almost random. AVOID!!
Boris Gorzalka ,2.5,5.0,N/A,"I'm taking this through distance ed, so there are no lectures. Assignment descriptions are very vague, but he seems to have one exact paper in his mind that he wants you to write. I had my tutor help me with my paper (who is just about to get his Ph.d) and I did poorly. I feel I am learning a ton, but that doesn't matter. I hope I pass the course."
Boris Gorzalka ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"The BEST Advisor EVER! Will stand up for his students and is the most honest person I've met at UBC. Very supportive and dedicated as a prof. Open to new ideas, unlike other profs here."
Boris Gorzalka ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Fantastic instructor. Makes even the most boring topics interesting. One of the few classes I looked forward to attending.  Unlike so many profs, he seems actually to like teaching and answering student questions."
Boris Gorzalka ,5.0,4.0,N/A,The tests (MC)can be tricky if you haven't read the textbook.  He's a great prof and really interesting (my boyfriend who doesn't even go to UBC would sit in on lectures to hear his stories).  I didn't do well on the first midterm but then I focused more on the textbook and aced the other 3 midterms and final.
Boris Gorzalka ,2.5,4.0,N/A,"He's one of them tenured prof you can tell isn't in it as much as he once was, he even told our class he only teaches first year pysch as a hobby, as hes been doing it for 20 something years. Most of his test are trivial and will make you hate MC tests. If youre going into first year with a passion for psych i can almost guarntee you he will kill i"
Boris Gorzalka ,5.0,2.0,N/A,fantastic!
Boris Gorzalka ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"Completely pedantic, not helpful, and expects us to memorize entire chapters of textbooks. I'm doing the course through Dist. Ed., and he asks questions on his quizzes like ""A ___ is a ____ that has taken a trip."" There is two chapters of material, and several things could fit into this blank, but he wants that exact sentence. Not educational."

Alan Kingstone ,5.0,3.0,N/A,Inclusive
Alan Kingstone ,1.0,4.0,B+,"Changed the grading scheme on the final exam (compared to the quizzes to deflate the marks).

Alan Kingstone ,1.0,5.0,N/A,this is a history of psych course. had to listen to AT LEAST 3 hours podcast each week sudden additional materials (5 extra pieces of readings) 4 days before the class. exam was tough: gave us 64 terms to prepare and test on 8 on the final. expect us to self learn instead of teaching. off topic discussion everylesson

Alan Kingstone ,5.0,4.0,N/A,Inspires critical thinking.  Focuses on the big picture.  Supportive.
Alan Kingstone ,1.0,3.0,A,"Took history of psyc. Had to watch 3 hours of useless podcasts every week, and a quiz on them every class (although easy, very  unnecessary). What was supposed to be a history class turned into an off topic discussion about social issues - he doesnt even lecture - its all class discussion and students would just say random things to get marks."
Alan Kingstone ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"No text. Just a huge pile of scholarly articles to read. 5-7 articles every week. Then during lecture, the whole class discusses the article. If you do not read the articles, you won't pass. If you skip, you also won't pass because the exam is all on in class discussion results. If you are a keener, take it. It's interesting."
Alan Kingstone ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Extremely interesting style of teaching, actually encourages critical thinking unlike most classes where rote memorization is key. Exams are easy and totally expected, no surprises, we actually prepare the questions ourselves (marking for it however may be a little tough) its a class thats easy to get an average mark in, easy not to fail, hard toA+"
Alan Kingstone ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"I DID NOT PLAN TO WRITE A COMMENT, BUT I THINK THAT THE LAST COMMENT IS FROM SOMEONE WHO DID NOT DO WELL IN THE CLASS. I AM TAKING 365 NOW AND I AGREE WITH MOST PEOPLE THAT THE CLASS IS DIFFERENT AND FUN.  AT FIRST I HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING ON BUT NOW I AM GETTING INTO THE CLASS AND LEARNING HOW TO READ AND THINK CRITICALLY."
Alan Kingstone ,2.0,4.0,N/A,"Doesn't so much teach as coach . You'll either like this or hate it. Good, up-to-date papers assigned to read, and if nothing else you'll learn to read papers(!) Each class starts with an often ridiculously hard quiz to see if you read the assigned papers. Nitpicky critique assignments you can't do well on without the right style. Exam was fair."
Alan Kingstone ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"Not an easy class to get a good grade in, but Kingstone is AWESOME. I learnt so much and even though it was a 2.5 hour night class, he made it so interesting. Definately take this class if you have interest in cognitive neuroscience."
Alan Kingstone ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"I think that the class was just great.  There is clearly a method to the ""madness"" as it got people talking and encouraged free discussion and thought.  Overall a very different, stimulating, fair, and creative class. (Plus the Prof. is extremely hot!)"
Laura Hanson ,3.0,5.0,A-,"Professor Hanson was very clear in her guidelines and was very quick and grading our papers and discussions. Her criteria is very clear and precise so it made it easy to do well on her assignments. However, her final is ridiculously hard so if you expect to cruise to an easy A with DQs and papers your sadly mistaken. Study hard throughout the term."
Laura Hanson ,1.0,4.0,N/A,"I found this class too independent. We received no lecture videos/presentations, no powerpoints, and no lecture notes. I wouldn't recommend the condensed, online version of this particular course with Hanson."
Laura Hanson ,1.0,4.0,N/A,"As a distance education class, I was not expecting much interaction between students and the prof, but she is barely there as an instructor. I've taken other distance education courses before, but this is worse. It was a 6-credit course with only 2 papers and 1 exam (40%), with 9 discussions (2%) each."
Laura Hanson ,1.0,3.0,N/A,First of all the syllabus is hard to find for her class. Dont count on following criteria to get by. Love how clear grading criteria is but still will not guarantee an even passing grade by following it. Good luck if you have this prof!
Laura Hanson ,5.0,3.0,A,"VERY fast grader. She really knows how to effectively lead a full-year online course. That said, if you decide to take the online version, make a schedule for yourself at outset. The course is not designed in such a way so as to force you to keep up. I liked this, but it isn't for everyone."
Laura Hanson ,1.0,4.0,N/A,"This class was totally unfair as the final was extremely specific and impossible to do well on. There were no assignments that tested you on the material prior to the final, so it was hard to know what to expect. Discussion 4%, Paper  36%, final 60% is an easy and lazy way to structure a class. Pretty unfair."
Laura Hanson ,3.0,5.0,B-,"I managed to pull off a B-. The term paper was a bit tough, but managed to score a B. The final was extremely discouraging, and everyone left the exam room with the same spaced out and dead expression on their face. Wouldn't really recommend."
Laura Hanson ,2.5,5.0,N/A,"I took PSYCH 300A  online over the summer, this class may seem easy because of the lack of assignments and work throughout the summer but the final exam was the hardest exam I have ever written. Since there was no midterm, everything from the textbook was a possible question. I do not recommend taking this class online. "
Laura Hanson ,4.0,4.0,A+,The text she uses is full of detail.  She is very helpful & quick to answer emails.  I studied my ass off and got 90% overall in the online course in Dec 2013 but sobbed in the bathroom after the final it was so hard - and not the same as the practice exam at all.   I would def recommend her but make sure you do your work!   
Laura Hanson ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"This was a great course! There were two multiple choice exams and though challenging, you will do fine if you study the text. Dr. Hanson is a very engaging lecturer and uses a lot of case examples and video clips - you will enjoy attending her lectures."
Laura Hanson ,4.0,4.0,N/A,"Very interesting course taught by a very knowledgeable professor. She will respond to questions and is helpful in that regard. This course covers a huge amount of complex material. Exam is the hardest I have ever had. You must know everything down to the finest detail, and no multiple choice.  Don't use the e-book - it is full of software issues."
Laura Hanson ,2.5,5.0,C-,"I am sure she is a nice lady, and a good prof to take on campus...however DO NOT take this class online.  There was no study guide for the terms, and we were told to basically just know everything.  I studied really hard, and I still hardly passes the course.  Was not very communicative online.  Felt I just taught myself."
Laura Hanson ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"Amazing prof! Really nice, exams are all MC so make sure you understand the details and differences between disorders. She is very very nice when you approach her. I had to take it as a SD and she was very supporting and even with that I got a 73 which is amazing for taking a course 1 year after the classes. Attend to class they're fun"
Laura Hanson ,5.0,3.0,N/A,This was my favourite course and favourite prof at UBC.  Dr. Hanson gives very clear and entertaining lectures and her exams (all m/c) are fair.   You will enjoy coming to class and will do well  in the course if you study.
Laura Hanson ,3.0,5.0,N/A,"Midterm was difficult; tested ""all material"" in text and lecture.  As for the final, Hanson said that she would remove the more difficult questions; however, this was clearly not the case with the final.  Obtuse, tricky questions throughout (A,B,C,A+B,B+C)/(A,B,C,None,2 of above)/etc.  Not GPA booster.  Prepare to spend many hours memorizing."
Laura Hanson ,5.0,2.0,N/A,Great teacher - made topics interesting and memorable. Would definitely take another class with her! Favorite class by far!
Laura Hanson ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"UBC would benefit from more instructors like her.  She's interesting, engaging and maintains high standards.  Dummies don't do well in this course."
Laura Hanson ,5.0,5.0,N/A,Best prof I have ever had. It's a tough class though. One tip is to ask lots of questions. She knows her stuff and gives really clear explanations.
Laura Hanson ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"I LOVED this class! She has so much first hand counselling knowledge and for the first time I felt like I was learning about things that happen to people instead of just psych theory. Super accessible information, always tries to keep it interesting. Exams can be tough but always fair - if you go to class and read the text once, you'll do well."
Laura Hanson ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"great prof with fair exams. shes very knowledgeable and uses some real life examples so shes really engaging. read the text once, but she likes to test mainly from her notes. i enjoyed the class a lot and got 91% just by showing up to every class !"
Robert McDonald ,5.0,3.0,N/A,Exceptional instructor. Makes students feel comfortable speaking their opinion. He's found a way to make BC history interesting - not the easiest thing to do. Gives out lecture notes; includes biblio. of sources at top of each one- you know he's not just making stuff up out of his head. Leads all of his own discussion groups; marks assign. himself.
Robert McDonald ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"He taught the second half of Canadian history. His photocopied notes were a real help, and indicated the important points that would be on the exam. He loves to talk about his hometown of Brandon, Manitoba and makes references to old hockey players but overall he's pretty entertaining."
Robert McDonald ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"Although I took it on a whim, BC History is one of my favorite classes I've taken at UBC- because of Dr. McDonald's style.  The readings were relevant and reasonable, the lectures were entertaining and discussion groups were great.  Just excellent!"
Robert McDonald ,4.0,4.0,N/A,"Extremely knowledgeable and interesting. Sometimes goes off on tangents which aren't always relevant. Very personable, cares about his students and the topic. Made BC history a worthwhile class"
Robert McDonald ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"Bob McDonald changed my entire conception of BC history. Bob McDonald taught me that first nations are an integral part of BC history, especially before 1880. His modernity thesis has some validity, but his constand reference to post-modernism must DIE."
Robert McDonald ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"Dedicated, passionate, down-to-earth, funny--those are characteristics that come to mind when I think of him as a professor."
Robert McDonald ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"Very good prof. Extremely knowledgeable and entertaining. However all the marking in 329 done by inconsistent TAs. His marking style is suprisingly fair. Would recommend 404 (BC History with no TAs) highly over 329. Take his class unless you think you might be irritated by constant references to modernity, his true obsession."
Robert McDonald ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"He's a great prof, one of the reasons I love Canadian History. I didn't like that everything was marked by TAs and they had inconsistent marking styles.  He was much better, more consistent marking, better lectures in Hist 404."
Robert McDonald ,3.0,5.0,N/A,"Professor McDonald is definitely a passionate teacher, however, I would not reccomend this course because no matter how hard you work the grades are highly unpredictable - probably because his TA's do all the marking. It was very hard to take notes in his class due to his stream of thought style."
Robert McDonald ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"I took his class 20 years ago and it is because of him that I really learned how to write great history papers. He is intelligent, passionate about the discipline, and knows how to teach undergraduate students. He is one of the reasons why I teach IB history to high school students."
Robert McDonald ,5.0,4.0,N/A,Engaging and well-taught. He makes history fun.
Robert McDonald ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"329 is a lot of work, having several papers due each term and weekly reading notes. You don't have to do any outside research for any of the assignments; they're all based on the class readings. The assignments will help you improve your interpretive skills. There is 1 exam, a final worth just 20%."
Robert McDonald ,5.0,2.0,N/A,One of the best!
Robert McDonald ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"Clearly very knowledge, enthusiastic, and helpful, but this course is DEATHLY boring. Overall, his lectures are pretty disorganized (lots of irrelevant details) and it's hard to decide what to study for final, but it's not too hard, and he's pretty good."
Robert McDonald ,1.0,5.0,N/A,avoid him at all costs...very disorganized and can't lecture well...way too many readings and the weekly reading notes are a pain in the ass!!!
Robert McDonald ,1.0,5.0,N/A,No Comments
Robert McDonald ,4.0,2.0,N/A,"Excellent prof, lectures and discussions. Hard to approach but he is a fair marker."
Robert McDonald ,5.0,2.0,N/A,I am considering a history major because of this course and his teaching.  His lectures are engaging and interesting. and I thought I didn't like history
Robert McDonald ,3.0,2.0,N/A,"Great lecturer, he really knows what he is talking about. Very interactive & interesting tutorials. Not so approachable when it comes to discussing term papers (you are left guessing) & seems like a different person in private."
Robert McDonald ,5.0,3.0,N/A,He wins teaching awards for a reason!
Christopher Friedrichs ,5.0,3.0,A,Dr. Friedrichs is the best history professor. He is so clear and easy to understand in class. It's apparent that he is interested and passionate about the topics. Also very accommodating and caring outside of class. Just be sure to do all the readings and attend lectures. Would definitely take another class with him!
Christopher Friedrichs ,5.0,3.0,N/A,What a gem! He is such a fantastic professor who will be missed dearly when he officially retires.
Christopher Friedrichs ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"He is so passionate and knowledgable in history, would love this class even more if he posted slides online! hard typing everything he says, but overall, good experience, excellent professor! Many readings, evaluations were fair!"
Christopher Friedrichs ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"incredible prof, one of the best I've ever had"
Christopher Friedrichs ,5.0,3.0,N/A,I love this teacher and class- friedrichs is really interesting and such a sweet prof!
Christopher Friedrichs ,5.0,3.0,N/A,I love this teacher and class- friedrichs is really interesting and such a sweet prof
Christopher Friedrichs ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Professor Friedrichs is amazing. His lectures are always gripping and I'm interested the whole time. By far my favorite professor. Going to the lectures is vital, but they're so well-done that I look forward to them anyways."
Christopher Friedrichs ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Amazing lecturer and professor - his lectures are incredibly interesting and informative. Kind and encouraging towards students. Exam structure is clearly given; must attend classes and discussions. This course covers a lot of material so expect a lot of readings and info retention. Despite the work, Prof Friedrichs made this class a joy to attend!"
Christopher Friedrichs ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Prof Friedrichs is an absolute gem. He doesn't use lecture slides so attendance to his lectures IS mandatory - however, his lectures are VERY enjoyable and rarely dry. He has an infectious enthusiasm for the subject material - I fondly refer to him as my History Grandfather. TAKE THOROUGH LECTURE NOTES - stuff from his lectures WILL be on exams."
Christopher Friedrichs ,5.0,2.0,A-,"Best prof I've had in history so far. He's a very interesting and engaging lecturer. Marking is fair, workload not too bad."
Christopher Friedrichs ,4.0,3.0,A,"Dr Friedrichs is a very good teacher, his lectures are interesting and cover a large range of themes and events. The readings assigned are very relevant (for most of them), but what I liked the most was the papers he gave us: so interesting and thought-provoking, I loved doing the research and writing them."
Christopher Friedrichs ,5.0,4.0,A-,"There's a lot of reading if you are taking him as a seminar prof, but he's incredibly helpful and  very clear. He organizes the discussions effectively and does talk, but not too long, just enough to get discussions rolling. What can I say that hasn't been said? He does mark essays hard, but he provides the support necessary for that."
Christopher Friedrichs ,5.0,3.0,B+,"This man is an amazing lecturer! I left the class often inspired by his passion for history. I would take it again in a heart beat, I learned so much. His lectures are funny and even though there was so much content for him to cover he managed to successfully  summarize everything we needed to know. Expectations are clearly laid out!"
Christopher Friedrichs ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"Professor Friedrichs is an exceptional professor. He is extremely engaging and passionate in his lectures. You won't find yourself bored in his class. Homework assignments are clear and fair. Exams are based off lectures and readings, but you can choose from many topics, so no surprises. Strongly recommended Professor. "
Christopher Friedrichs ,3.5,3.0,A-,"This was a two term course with A LOT of assigned reading. Because it is a survey course it is fast paced and there is a ton of information. Take detailed notes and study with a friend and you'll be fine.  When he noticed the drop in attendance, Professor Friedrichs focused much of the exam on lecture content."
Christopher Friedrichs ,4.5,2.0,A+,"Excellent professor. Only class where I can pay attention straight for an hour and stay interested. He makes history come to life. Respectful of different opinions in discussion, assessment was straightforward: participation in discussion, midterm, final paper, exam. Would definitely take another class with him. "
Christopher Friedrichs ,5.0,2.0,B+,"I have taken three 6 credit courses with Friedrichs, and if I had it my way, he would teach all of my courses. Not only is he a wonderful, passionate, effective prof, he is inspiring, kind, and is charming, both in and outside of class. Best experience at UBC was taking classes with him."
Christopher Friedrichs ,5.0,2.0,N/A,Great Prof! Totally recommend!
Christopher Friedrichs ,4.0,2.0,N/A,"great teacher, if you ever get a chance to take his courses, TAKE IT BEFORE IT""S TOO LATE!!"
Christopher Friedrichs ,4.5,1.0,N/A,"Take a class with Friedrichs if you get a chance, even if you're not a history major. He is interesting and funny, and his expectations are straight-forward and fair."
Sandy Tomc ,4.0,4.0,N/A,"She has her own style, but Dr. Tomc should not be underestimated. She has such a wealth of knowledge to share, and she can make the most impenetrable theory seem understandable. If you have a chance to take a class with her, do it. She is an incredibly kind and intelligent individual and I learned so much from her."
Sandy Tomc ,4.0,2.0,A-,"This class was great. Very interesting material, and well presented. Some people complained a lot, but I can't relate to it - the only point of confusion for me was about the group presentation. Midterm was actually fun, as we got to take it home and rewrite it as an assignment -- wish I could do that in more classes."
Sandy Tomc ,4.0,4.0,N/A,Super interesting and a fair marker! She really knows her stuff. I would undoubtably recommend taking any upper level class you can with her!
Sandy Tomc ,3.5,2.0,N/A,"Really great reading list, class can sometimes seem a little all-over-the-place, but you can tell she's really interested in the subject (American Noir). Fair marker, if you show as much interest in it as she does you'll do well in the class. Good prof, good books (and movies! you watch movies!), overall great class."
Sandy Tomc ,4.0,2.0,N/A,"i dont know what everyone is complaining about, she is maybe the easiest marker at UBC, and you do not have to regurgitate what she says, she is open to all interpretations as long as you can back it up. go to class and you're golden"
Sandy Tomc ,3.5,3.0,N/A,"I failed my midterm (worth 25%) due to personal problems and SHE WAS NICE ENOUGH TO OMIT IT. she said that if i did well on my term paper + final exam, she'd omit the midterm. so i ended up getting an A in the course. WOO"
Sandy Tomc ,5.0,5.0,N/A,"Dr. Tomc is the best professor I have ever had.  It is VERY hard to get an A+ in this class...she rarely gives over 90% unless the work is extraordinary.  But you will learn a lot!  She is intelligent, well-prepared, passionate about the material, and very approachable.  GO TO CLASS, and PARTICIPATE...only way to get a good mark from her."
Sandy Tomc ,3.5,2.0,N/A,"Overall a pretty good prof. Lectures are clear and straightforward, and midterm/final had no surprises. Just show up to lecture and do the readings, and you will do well. Final assignment was short and fairly easy. Overall I'd recommend this course and professor."
Sandy Tomc ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"Scary, Weird, sick minded, total sociopath. This woman is mean mean mean. Stay away from her if you want to keep your dignity"
Sandy Tomc ,2.5,2.0,N/A,"She made a topic that could of been really interesting REALLY BORING! She was totally unorganized, and talked about irrelevant information and that was not needed for the final. I was not inspired to come to class because it was a major waste of time and she discussed things that were almost common sense!"
Sandy Tomc ,3.0,1.0,N/A,"Ugh. Really boring. Too many movies and not enough reading. Lectures were not very engaging and somewhat disjointed. Madatory attendance. Felt like a waste of time and money!! Not recommended...although I am sure there are worse english profs out there. She was nice, at least. And had low expectations."
Sandy Tomc ,4.0,2.0,N/A,"Intelligent, intriguing, pleasant, fair. Knows how to teach."
Sandy Tomc ,4.5,4.0,N/A,"Professor Tomc is amazing! She is very knowledgeable about the material and knows exactly what she's talking about. She's endearing in class with her awkwardness, and makes it fun that way. Tomc was a hard marker when it came to the midterm, but the take-home assignment was simple, and if you did all the readings, the final exam was a piece of cake"
Sandy Tomc ,5.0,2.0,N/A,I loved Dr. Tomc! The readings were great and really interesting. Her lectures are laid back and very easy to participate in. She is a fair marker and prepares students well for exams and papers. I would definitely recommend her...probably one of the better profs I've had so far.
Sandy Tomc ,2.5,3.0,N/A,"Didn't seem bad at first, but be warned, she is completley unsympathetic if you don't go to all the lectures and talk a lot. I did the assignments on time and got good marks, but she claimed to have never recieved my term paper and failed me and was totally indifferent to the attempts I made to prove that I had done it. Waste of my money and effort"
Sandy Tomc ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"Absolutely fantastic, made her lectures extremely interesting and added so much to the course material.  Straightforward marker, go to the lectures, and enjoy"
Sandy Tomc ,4.5,2.0,N/A,tomc is awesome!  i had her in engl110 and she was really easy which is why i took her again!  she is really straightforward and basically tells you all the answers and all the important points.  just make sure you go to the lectures- you dont even need to do all the readings!  she's really easy!!
Sandy Tomc ,5.0,2.0,N/A,AWESOME PROF! She is super funny and makes the class interesting.. don't know how she marks because the T.A.s did it all.. i will definetly try to get her as a prof though for my later ENGL courses!
Sandy Tomc ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"I'm not the greatest at English, but I think I did relatively all right in this class.  Her marking was fair.  It wasn't as rash as how she admits in class either.  Like the previous, you listen, you pass with a ""B"" at least.  I liked this class."
Sandy Tomc ,4.0,1.0,N/A,"i don't know what everyone is complaining about. i found her to be a very lenient marker. as long as you listened in class, you could basically regurgitate everything back during the exams. she made her points very clear and her class discussions were very interesting. i really enjoyed this clas :)"
William Ramey ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"One of the best MICB profs, hands down.  He is extremely helpful and offers very insightful feedback.  He teaches you the course material in gory detail, but you will thank  him for it later on, trust me."
William Ramey ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Insanely patient and helpful. The man's mind is an encyclopedia of Microbiology. Though you may find him boring at first, every bit of information that comes from Dr Ramey is useful. You just need listen."
William Ramey ,5.0,3.0,N/A,Sweetest prof I've ever had. Will help you with absolutely anything.
William Ramey ,2.0,4.0,N/A,"Boooooo!  Overexplains all the simple stuff and leaves the hard stuff for you to muddle out and guess at on exams.  Lecture is a total waste of time, and lab is torture!  The TA's for the course are super nice though."
William Ramey ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"Sometimes very hard to understand, But still the nicest prof. This man wrote all my Medical school and Dental school references. Always available to help students out."
William Ramey ,5.0,3.0,N/A,Excellent Prof.  Will help a student with anything.
William Ramey ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Clearly the most helpful professor in Micro, maybe all of the Faculty of science. Don't pay attention to the people who have rated him poorly, all they do is improperly skew the rating.  He will teach you material as well as help you learn how to think critically.  If you get him talkinghewont stop."
William Ramey ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"Most helpful prof i've had @ UBC! He takes your hand and teaches you stuff, no really... he does.  He taught me how to lit up a bunsen burner... the correct way..."

Don Dutton ,3.0,4.0,B,"Two tests worth 50% each, lecture notes have insane amount of material in them, textbook is clear and concise, his exams are very tricky, tough to break 80%, 100 multiple choice with answer d.) being all the above on every. single. question. Very tough exams but very interesting material."
Don Dutton ,3.0,2.0,N/A,"Very smart guy and interesting subject. Not great in lecture, but all the information is available in the text and on the powerpoint slides so its not a huge deal. Has some interesting case studies and real world information to give. 2 exams 50% each all m/c so just read the slides and the text and you can easily pull off 80+."
Don Dutton ,2.5,5.0,N/A,"Made a very interesting topic incredibly boring. lectures are LONG, powerpoint slides are even LONGER. His resume and accomplishments are very impressive but not a good lecturer. You'll end up cramming the whole textbook the night before the exam."
Don Dutton ,1.5,4.0,C+,"Dutton is clearly an extremely  impressive forensic psychologist but lacks the qualities of a good professor. 3hr class, lectures were insane (100-180 PP slides FULL of text each class) and he expects you to know random details on exams. Hard to know what is important or not. MUST attend class and read text. Would not take another class with him.  "
Don Dutton ,1.5,4.0,N/A,This class is one of the worst PSYC classes I have taken at UBC. He has over 100 lecture slides per week which all have a lot of text on them. Hard to know what to study for the exams and the average was super low for our class. 
Don Dutton ,3.0,2.0,A+,"Interesting course, fair exams (1 midterm & final). Exams covers 50% on lecture notes and 50% on textbook materials. Read the textbook, attend his lectures, and you'll do really well in this class. Dr. Dutton is great!"
Don Dutton ,2.0,4.0,N/A,Very interesting topics! He has great stories to tell which make the class' go by fast. There's a midterm and final (50%-50%). The exams are fairly hard but you just have to read the material.
Don Dutton ,5.0,2.0,N/A,I actually really enjoyed having Dutton as a prof! Sometimes lectures were pretty boring (ie he read off the slides the whole time) but he throws in a few jokes every now and then. Definitely read the textbook; exam covers every ppt + assigned chapter! Read slides + text and you'll be fine.
Don Dutton ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"THE WORST PSYCH COURSE I HAVE EVER TAKEN AT UBC EVER. I have taken a lot of psychology courses but this was just BRUTAL. he does not provide any guidance as to what to study, just tests us on the MOST ITTY BITTY DETAILS. I was interested in the material prior to taking this class, but destroyed all interest. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS."
Don Dutton ,1.5,4.0,N/A,"He is so terrible, don't take his class. Lectures put you to sleep, and unless you want to cram over 1000 lectures slides plus 10 chapters for one exam don't take it no matter how interesting you find the topic area. DONT TAKE THIS CLASS..."
Don Dutton ,1.5,4.0,C+,All those other ratings were true; I thought there were harsh before. Dutton is by far the worst professor I've had and it's my last year. He is always unorganized and expects people to just know about stuff if he puts them on his website. He talks A LOT about details of a case but never tests on them. Half of testing with be purely on the text.
Don Dutton ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"Prof Don is a really nice guy that will help you if you go to him with questions, but is a pretty dry lecturer. He reads off the slides practically word-for-word, which isn't so bad since the material is pretty interesting, but it can be really easy to zone out at times. Take his class, make sure to read the slides and text, and you'll do great."
Don Dutton ,3.5,2.0,N/A,"Interesting prof to listen to, but no point going to his lectures because he goes through his slides too fast. Honestly, I got an A in this course and I went to 5/12 lectures in the term. Do the study guides he posts online, read the textbook once and you'll be fine. His exams are easy- anyone who's taken  Souza's exams knows what a hard exam is."
Don Dutton ,3.0,3.0,N/A,The content is quite easy to understand so I was under the impression that the tests would be easy? But my grade didn't translate well. I do believe that if i didn't take it for granted i'd get better grades. Its one of the less stressful psyc classes since its only one midterm. prof is trying to change the syllabus to accomodate our learning paces
Don Dutton ,4.0,4.0,N/A,very interesting material. didnt attend his lectures because his monotone makes me fall asleep. 50/50 midterm and final but changed it to 40/60 (whichever higher is 60) because our midterm exam avg was 57%.
Don Dutton ,3.5,3.0,N/A,"Very knowledgeable about his materials; did not use the textbook.  Lectures were at fast pace, use his own slides, usually has several revisions. Use lots of research materials to prove his points. Midterm and exam were 50/50, but he change his mind to have 60% for the highest score of the two.  I would say it's fair."
Don Dutton ,1.0,4.0,N/A,"Worst Prof I have ever had. He does not care at all! Classes ended an hour early, slides had nothing to do with textbook and his lectures were sensational and lacked depth or analysis. Learning experience extremely low and exams impossibly vague. He admitted to not knowing what chapters were on the exam the week before, careless prof!"
Don Dutton ,1.5,3.0,N/A,"One of the worst prof i've ever had. Lectures were outdated and textbook had no relevance to lecture. Also lectures were depressing and used examples of violence all to often to prove points, in fact probably 90% of the time."
Don Dutton ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"He's really interesting to talk to, and if you show interest, will go above and beyond with helping you out. His lectured are also VERY interesting- I always looked forward to his classes!he talks abt his experiences quite a lot, but since he's had a ton of experience in the field, its relevant and really cool to hear stuff like that first hand!"
Don Dutton ,4.5,2.0,N/A,Very interesting Prof. Good lecturer. I recommend him for social psych
Andrew Adler ,5.0,1.0,C+,Great professor so helpful. Great human being. It was an honor to meet him. Meeting him gave me my career as a mathemtaics teacher and he is mostly responsible for it. I am forever grateful to him. May the best come for you in your life.
Andrew Adler ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"he was the best professor, but most importantly he is a great human being"
Andrew Adler ,3.5,2.0,N/A,It's been a while since I took the course. But I remember he was pretty good.
Andrew Adler ,2.0,5.0,N/A,The textbook for this course is easy. To bad we dont really use it.
Andrew Adler ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"His appearance might be misleading as well as his teaching stile, but after a few classes you’ll realise that he is the most experienced and knowledgeable prof in the department. Go to his office hours and do the homework and you’ll get at least a B+."
Andrew Adler ,1.5,5.0,N/A,"I am flabbergasted that he was someone's best prof, our whole class was frustated;  lectures almost incomprehempossible, you need to go to the TA's just to be able to do the weekly assignments because the textbook doesn't cover most topics. The course gets easier, decipher his notes after class. The final was easier than the assignments."
Andrew Adler ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"BEST PROF EVER.  I am an arts student, and in my five years of university, this was my favorite prof.  He's hilarious, is a great teacher, and more importantly, understands how students understand and retain information.  He is a pedagogical master of mathmatics!"
Andrew Adler ,1.5,4.0,N/A,Taking this class because it's required for the education faculty. Adler is nice and funny but spends our 4 hours a week doing problems on the board without giving us any rules/formulas/overarching themes....pretty frusterating. i will be passing the class thanks to my tutor who's doing the actual teaching. text is next to useless.
Andrew Adler ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"well, he is the greatest math prof at ubc. His lecture is full of wit. He makes math fun and simple. Too bad he is going to retired."
Andrew Adler ,5.0,4.0,N/A,Very nice teacher
Andrew Adler ,2.5,3.0,N/A,"Textbook was useless, class notes and practice exams were the way to go.  I thought his midterms were harder than the final.  Talks a little slow and boring, but math is never fun."
Andrew Adler ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Addy's great. He's quiet, so sit up front. His website has examples, notes, and answers which was SO SO SO HELPFUL! His class covers the basics, which is understandable because the knowledge range of the students coming in is so varied, but he provides LOADS of material for A and other students on his website...you gotta do it for yourself!!!!!!!!!"
Andrew Adler ,4.0,4.0,N/A,"I'm terrible at math, and I only took it cuz I had to, but he's a pretty good prof. His tests are hard, really hard, and have nothing to do with his notes or homework. Study old tests, it's a better use of your time. Funny guy, with good jokes, but the tests are hard (and i take good notes)"
Andrew Adler ,3.0,5.0,N/A,he always jokes abt france being better than england. waterloo shall drain into a stinkin trench!
Andrew Adler ,5.0,3.0,N/A,very smart
Andrew Adler ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"funny guy; shows interests in math; challenges students to a higher level.  great professor, to me the best math prof at ubc!!!"
Andrew Adler ,3.0,2.0,N/A,"he's not hard, as logn as u take the notes and look at them, u'll do well. I got A+"
Andrew Adler ,3.0,3.0,N/A,"i love his wierd sense of humour. though his lectures get a lil boring, his uncalled for jokes makes up for it. gotta love his sandels too! you definately need to go over past midterms and other practice work to do well."
Andrew Adler ,4.0,4.0,N/A,"Adler is a great guy, but he is a bit snobby. He's entertaining, funny and engaging but his tests are HARD. Note: HARD"
Andrew Adler ,4.0,4.0,N/A,"Great prof!  Midterm questions have nothing to do with textbook.  More helpful to do past midterms for practise than textbook questions.  Midterms are hard, but very possible to get good grade if you understand how to apply material."
Phil Loewen ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"Very good and respectable prof, also a piazza god"
Phil Loewen ,5.0,5.0,N/A,"Amazing professor, who inspires conceptual understanding and learning rather than hard work. study smart"
Phil Loewen ,5.0,5.0,N/A,"Amazing professor and also one of the hardest (if not the hardest) courses I've ever taken. His energy during lectures is great, and he makes the content very interesting. Even then, the midterms are very challenging so study off anywhere you can. The exam questions are unique and really test your understanding."
Phil Loewen ,3.5,3.0,N/A,"He is a good person, always there to help. But he tries to make the scienceengineering course concepts look like a novel to read. It will be good if his teaching and notes are not wordy."
Phil Loewen ,5.0,4.0,N/A,A great prof 
Phil Loewen ,5.0,1.0,N/A,Took his class during the summer and as a professor  he is great.  The content could be difficult if your not keeping up but overall the final exam and previous exams felt straight forward and definitely do able.
Phil Loewen ,4.0,1.0,A+,"I'm not sure what all the complaints on difficulty are about, or where they came from, but my experience with dr. Loewen has been positive all-round. He is an excellent teacher, giving a well balanced mix of theory and example, and his tests are absolutely fair and manageable, not to mention he marks very fairly. Take him if you want to learn math."
Phil Loewen ,3.0,5.0,N/A,"Dr. Loewen is really nice, and genuinely wants to help students learn. However, he tends to over complicate things and a simple subject can be explained in such a way that confuses even Einstein."
Phil Loewen ,2.5,5.0,N/A,"A really nice guy and really clear in lecture, but an ineffective professor. The experience overall left a bad taste - exams were much more difficult in comparison to what was actually taught and the requirements on the syllabus."
Phil Loewen ,4.5,4.0,N/A,"Exams are extremely difficult; the questions showing up can be unpredictable. However, he is very helpful in and outside of class and genuinely a really nice guy. He's funny, speaks clearly and has enthusiasm for what he teaches. Loewen didn't really use a textbook which would have made it easier for me personally to follow along in class."
Phil Loewen ,2.0,5.0,N/A,Hardest exams in the first three years of civil engineering for sure. They are not relevant to the course material whatsoever. Pierce is far better from what I have heard. I don't ever do these things but he was that bad.
Phil Loewen ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"Unreasonable evaluations all around. Assignments focus on abstract stuff, useless to prepare you for exams. Very little examples done in class - useless derivations and proofs only. Had to teach myself. No effort to make the course relevant to engineering, and the majority of the class happens to be in engineering. Take it with Pierce if you can."
Phil Loewen ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"So incredibly helpful and understanding of students, and non-judgemental, although the course is very tough. Taught myself out of textbook mostly but his in class notes are more thorough. Go to his office hours!! Difficult but reasonable exams."
Phil Loewen ,1.5,5.0,N/A,"An anomaly: a quick, clever thinker, enthusiastic and engaged, whom I cannot at all recommend. Explanations were absurdly complex, with no reference points or labels.  He managed to confuse me about material I’d already learned and practiced on my own!  My math friends explained the same material in a fraction of the time, and far more clearly."
Phil Loewen ,1.0,5.0,N/A,I should have skipped every class and taught myself the course. This guy's useless.
Phil Loewen ,1.5,5.0,N/A,"This is the hardest teacher I have ever had. He makes the material much harder than it needs to be. Others i have spoken to, who have taken this course with a different prof, have found the course to be trivial. Our course consisting of the brightest minds was %30. I relied on Paul's notes, khan academy, and chegg to get by,"
Phil Loewen ,4.5,5.0,N/A,His tests are absurd. Basically impossible to understand what they hell he is asking. You can go into a test knowing the content and still fail hard due to the fact that you couldn't answer the indecipherable cryptic questions.
Phil Loewen ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"Super clear notes & stuff. Boring lecture. If you are math major hes pretty good. For non-math major, avoid. BTW, easy on marking (exam), but super loooooooooong homework takes 4ever to finish."
Phil Loewen ,2.0,5.0,N/A,"Oh man where do I even start. Average lectures. Nothing phenomenal.  HOWEVER: HIS EXAMS ARE KILLER! If you thought your life was tough enough as is, you clearly haven't taken Loewen's classes.  Take something else with another professor is all I can say.  I still have nightmares about how horrible it was (and I got a decent mark)."
Phil Loewen ,2.0,5.0,N/A,"to be honest, his lectures were average math class, be there,and take notes. BUT his final was unbelievablly hard and long!! nobody in my class finished it! it was just ridiculous!!run fast, run far from his class, especially summer sections. you will have self-esteem issues after his exams, trust me,i regreted already."
Brian Seymour ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"Good teacher, explained things and had good lectures. Its a hard course but he got the message across."
Brian Seymour ,3.5,3.0,N/A,Fair prof. Class average was average. the markings were fair and midterms were not hard. goes fast on certain topics but is a decent math teacher.
Brian Seymour ,3.0,3.0,N/A,"He is definitely a fair prof; he did teach the required material and midterms were fair. However, I often found that he went too fast in lectures, leading many students to be confused. Sometimes his notes were somewhat messy as well. So I'd say he's average; not super great, but not bad either."
Brian Seymour ,3.5,2.0,N/A,"Cons: goes through concepts too fast, sometimes not clear, mutters, poor notes. Pros: gives sufficient examples in class, made a list of homework questions, finished teaching cirriculum with a few classes to spare.  He's definitely not your ideal prof, but if you're stuck with him, just work hard and  you'll be fine."
Brian Seymour ,2.0,5.0,N/A,"His examples often have mistakes. He often doesn't teach material that is examinable and enjoys going off topic. Midterms harder than final, by A LOT."
Brian Seymour ,4.0,4.0,N/A,"""Green's Functions and Variational Methods"" A really nice prof. Quite helpful and enthusiastic. Has experience on and knows what he's talking about. Interested in teaching. Interesting topics. It is a course you want to spend some extra time on. Not an easy one though ;) RECOMMENDED!"
Brian Seymour ,2.0,5.0,N/A,examples are from engineering or something...cant even begin to understand those....notes are not in any sort of order...just goes to whatever page he feels like....midterms hard...finals even harder...not recommended
Brian Seymour ,1.0,5.0,N/A,The professor seemed to talk to himself only while he was lecturing
Brian Seymour ,1.5,3.0,N/A,Very boring prof.   Goes through notes way too fast so is very hard to follow.
Brian Seymour ,1.0,3.0,N/A,"Notes followed no logical chronology.  Important theorem/lemmas/corollaries/definitions not given higher emphasis than trivial ones.  Midterm tough.  Final crazy.  401 was better than 400.  If you ask about his graduate advisor, whatever you do, don't laugh."
Brian Seymour ,4.5,4.0,N/A,"he was a good prof, course was interesting, if you did homework the midterms were easy, overall a good prof."
Brian Seymour ,4.5,4.0,N/A,A fairly good prof. He does talk about a bit more theory than the course requires. Overall he's pretty clear and his notes are good.
Brian Seymour ,1.0,2.0,N/A,boring prof he is. Math is not supposed to be THAT boring.
Brian Seymour ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"By far, one of the best at UBC.  Study and you'll do well.  NO BS"
Brian Seymour ,2.0,5.0,N/A,"Cares nothing for students, should avoid.  Midterm was ok, final nicely challenging.  Notes were poor, lecturing slightly below mediocre.  Math 400 exams correlated with homework, Math 401 students said 401 final had 2/5 questions notfrom homework though."
Brian Seymour ,2.5,5.0,N/A,"just too darn smart to be teaching undergrad. his explanations START way above everyone's head. but, he did do his job, got the info out there and had several interesting anecdotes to spice it up"
Brian Seymour ,2.0,5.0,N/A,"Hard stuff with not much useful examples..... Finals was all on one subject, so its either you know it or you dont. Lots of useless information within the course, which doesnt relate to the finals/midterm."
Brian Seymour ,3.0,4.0,N/A,"Generally lacking in examples, and focusses on theoretical work.  Poor at answering questions, and assignments and midterms are reasonably challenging"
Brian Seymour ,2.5,4.0,N/A,"Dr. Seymour is a decent teacher, but he does not seem to care at all about his students. He is horrible at answering questions. When are math profs going to start using modern teaching methods? At UBC I expect more."
Brian Seymour ,4.5,1.0,N/A,Midterms very easy.  He taught everything in an understandable way
Les Burtnick ,5.0,1.0,A+,"His notes are amazing and very informative. This course is very easy but you have to put in the effort. Burtnick is an amazing professor. He tells you exactly what you need to know. Pay attention in class, review notes regularly, and do the practice mts and it's impossible not to get an A. He's also very kind and approachable if you need help."
Les Burtnick ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"While lectures can be slightly dry, I found classes to be useful and the exams were fair."
Les Burtnick ,2.0,4.0,N/A,Horrible teacher who didn't know how to relay his information to the class in an effective manner. Was boring and unhelpful.
Les Burtnick ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"Dr. Burtnick is a good instructor; he was very clear about what we were expected to know, and gave good notes.  He was also quite helpful during his office hours.  The course was quite easy as well, but not terribly interesting."
Les Burtnick ,4.0,1.0,N/A,"I found Dr. Burtnick to be a , kind and decent teacher. Yes, he sometimes gets lost in his own derivations and the class is boring (phys chem), but he tries hard to convey all the important concepts and is very willing to answer questions. The course isn't too hard."
Les Burtnick ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"Contrary to what these other guys say, I think hes a pretty decent teacher. I think the first years just have not met a truly BAD teacher. If you guys think hes bad, you won't know what will hit you later on. He is pretty clear on what he expects you to know, and explains it pretty clearly when people have issues with it. Much better than expected."
Les Burtnick ,3.0,4.0,N/A,"A nice approachable person, however just couldn't hold the attention of the class, especially over the Quantum Mechanics Chapters"
Les Burtnick ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"He only posts 1 or 2 slides every chap, which is useless to prepare for midterm/final.  It would be smart to go to other prof's lectures/work with a study group if you wanna pass the final.  And honestly, going to his class was a waste of time.  Watch out for his in-class quizzes as it is tougher than you expect."
Les Burtnick ,1.5,4.0,N/A,"omg.the worst prof ever.I didnt understand him at all. He is very unorganized and notes are inconsistant.He is no help too.I tried to ask him questions,but it only made me more confused.He puts u off.He will be like we learned that in class,and u should know tht by now.I hve to take other prof's lectures in order to learn the material.DONT TAKE HIM"
Les Burtnick ,1.0,4.0,N/A,"Lectures very confusing and poorly explained. PPT slides not posted on Vista so copy down the notes and try and make sense of it later. Notes are not good! Textbook = Useless + Expensive. Do the problem sets and go see TA's for help. Prep 101 is a HUGE help for exam prep. Overall, prof is boring, course is boring, midterm = medium, final = HARD"
Les Burtnick ,2.5,5.0,N/A,"work hard, i didnt put in my best effort and it showed in my mark , now i just don't know if it was b/c i had a really bad prof or i didn't work at it, cuz he sure aint da best"
Les Burtnick ,2.0,4.0,N/A,"His lectures are useless because he won't post his notes on Vista. So if you want to go back and review them, you can't. Plus, neither the textbook or his lectures teach the material well. Both are meant to be supplements to your learning, not teachings."
Les Burtnick ,4.0,2.0,N/A,He's very cute. Likes to walk from one side of the class to another when teaching. He has very interesting exam questions; makes you think. Not the most interesting class; especially the physical chem section! But overall fair. I liked him.
Les Burtnick ,5.0,3.0,N/A,Great Prof! Gets his points across and very organized. Very informative and he's got lots of offer!
Les Burtnick ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"Not the most exciting class, but very clear and helpful notes provided; is ready to help when asked."
Les Burtnick ,1.5,3.0,A,"crappy text book (don't get it), boring lectures, too many notes (bring a lap top), hard midterm (highest mark in a 250 person class was 76%), if you don't already understand your physical chem then you'll have a hard time in the course unless you work extremely hard and do all the questions (with out looking @ the answers first)"
Les Burtnick ,4.0,3.0,A,"Les Burtnick is a good teacher.  He can be kind of boring, and he does teach fast, but if you pay attention in his class you will pick up a lot.  As with any course, if you work hard you will do fine."
Les Burtnick ,5.0,1.0,A,"Dr. Burtnick is the nicest professor ever; he had NEVER got mad with us. His midterm was very easy (I got 100% but screwed the final due to careless mistakes), but make sure you do all of his problem sets.  Btw, you may rely on his notes without that crappy textbook.  But so much notes to copy, gotta write FAST!"
Les Burtnick ,5.0,2.0,A,Awesome prof - clear notes and fair exams given.  Best prof to take for this course!
Les Burtnick ,2.0,4.0,A,"Burtnick is a fair prof; too much writing in class, but good notes.  Do the problem sets!"
Gillian Watson ,4.5,4.0,N/A,"I took Social Psyc in the summer with her. I appreciated her weekly quizzes because it helped prep me for the final.  Yes she's pretty hard (her written questions are really demanding but MC is easy) but if you're willing to put in some effort for a good grade, she's no problem at all.  Very nice person overall."
Gillian Watson ,3.0,4.0,N/A,"Sweet lady, her class was fairly boring and made me not wanting to listen in class. Notes are very detailed yet difficult to use as it was not organized."
Gillian Watson ,4.5,1.0,N/A,Very sweet lady.  I took her 205 and 308 class. Material overlapped SIGNIFICANTLY so it was like taking the same course twice.  Her notes are among the best I've had and are rather self-explanatory.  she won't pull any surprises on you during exams.  Found her classes to be relatively easy -- as long as you study!
Gillian Watson ,4.0,1.0,N/A,Good professor. resonable tests
Gillian Watson ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"Nice prof.class attendance is necessary as almost half of the questions on test will be from her lectures.Tests are fair except she marks the written questions really hard.You have to provide her with details.Not the most interesting course ,at times it could get boring and repititive.But the prof does a good job ."
Gillian Watson ,4.0,4.0,N/A,"I loved her; Classes were very interesting and go by super fast; Always asking if anyone has any questions; Exams were somewhat difficult, where studying and preparing is obviously a must; Average was around 65%, but it is very possible to get well above it, just put in some time and effort."
Gillian Watson ,2.5,3.0,N/A,"I thought that Dr. Watson was awful. She was so boring that I couldn't go to class. I memorized the textbook and did well in the class so, to sum up she is useless."
Gillian Watson ,4.0,5.0,N/A,"This course is really a lot of work. You need to know the text book inside and out to excel. Prof. Watson is very fair with what she tests on and  helpful in office hours. It you are in her section, you are pretty well guaranteed that the marks will not be scaled down as she is one of the harder profs for psych (she said so herself!)"
Gillian Watson ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"She was a really good prof that definitely knew her stuff!  Her tests were kind of hard, but it's all about how much studying you do, and whether you go to her lectures or not.  She was also pretty hilarious at times and I just really enjoyed her as a prof!  I'd definitely like to take another that she's teaching!"
Gillian Watson ,2.0,4.0,N/A,"i hated this class. it was so boring, and she can't stop talking about herself"
Gillian Watson ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"She gives some really interesting examples in lectures. Her lecture presentation is very clear and organized. Since there is only one paper each term, and everyone need to write with a partner, no need to struggle too much on it. The exams are hard but as long as you read every chapter of the textbook, you'll do very well."
Gillian Watson ,5.0,4.0,N/A,GREATEST PROF EVS!!! SOOO HILAR'S!!!
Gillian Watson ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Her exams are very fair. If you study all the stuff in her lecture, you can get above average. She is very helpful and kind professor who explains until you can understand! Don't hesitate to go to her office."
Gillian Watson ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"i dun think she is a good prof, i dun really like her. her exams are so hard and all u need to study is juz the textbook and the video u hv watched during classes."
Gillian Watson ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"Wost class ever. Exams are soooo hard. If you dont understand the lecture you are screwed because she wrote the textbook for the class, so its the same wording and concepts she used in class. Seriously, dont take the class with the horrible horrible prof. Her tests are so random and hard, 50 ppl failed the class, it could be you too."
Gillian Watson ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"Shes VERy CLEAR!!! walks you through everything, take notes form ur text and pay attn in class! there are lots of hints! very fair, DO well in her class- no excuse not tovery attentive, ask as many q's as you want!"
Gillian Watson ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"Had her for 205 also. I really liked her, and her accent is pleasant to listen to. Tests are very fair."
Gillian Watson ,2.0,5.0,N/A,pretty mean when i tried to ask questions. so if i missed something you said b/c 1)you werent too clear or 2)ppl were talking around me then that gives you a reason to be all pissed at me? gee.. like an old lady that looks nice and sweet but is actually cranky and mean. she likes to answer my question with accusing tones...
Gillian Watson ,3.5,4.0,N/A,"She is very nice and her lectures are interesting. She tries hard to get you to receive a good grade by posting up notes for lectures and practice exams on-line.  If you've taken some sort of psyc class before, don't take this as it's too simple and you'll lose interest after the first couple of weeks. Otherwise, I'd recommend her."
Gillian Watson ,4.5,3.0,N/A,Excellent teaching style.  Very interested in course subject matter.  Very clear with expectations re: exams.  Reviews main points on all articles we are asked to read.  Posts practice exams on the web.  Does her best to help students do well.  If any annoyance portrayed...due to students asking questions when should have paid attention during clas
Izabella Laba ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"what else can I say, the lectures are so good"
Izabella Laba ,2.0,3.0,N/A,"Rather opinionated and political but fortunately this does not manifest in the grading. She was generous enough to make decent notes during the coronavirus situation, but otherwise her response to the crisis was slow and she spent more time on Twitter than dealing with the course."
Izabella Laba ,4.0,1.0,A+,Solid prof. Teaches you what you need to know. Super easy exams. The midterm average was close to 90%.
Izabella Laba ,4.0,5.0,B,"Ok lecturer. Can be somewhat uninteresting, but explains things well and uses the chalkboard like a pro. Textbook is helpful but lectures are crucial to doing well. Exams are tough, but that's expected for Honours."
Izabella Laba ,5.0,4.0,A,Prof. Laba is an excellent instructor who is very knowledgable and respected. Her proofs were crystal clear and she related the course material (Harmonic analysis) to other areas of mathematics such as Partial Differential Equations.
Izabella Laba ,4.0,3.0,A+,"Lectures, which are decent, are important as you can't rely on the textbook itself (it is unreadable without knowing the lectures). You do need to put in effort into the homework to get a good grade. Tests are quite fair, which something I appreciated. If you put in a few more hours of work than in MATH 200, you can do reasonably well."
Izabella Laba ,3.0,3.0,N/A,"Has very nice handwriting, but her lectures are pretty boring. Course was pretty easy for an honours math course though, much easier than 223. She's pretty dry in office hours as well, but the course organization is good, as she's taught it many times before."
Izabella Laba ,2.0,3.0,N/A,boring lectures
Izabella Laba ,3.0,4.0,A+,"Readability of the textbook is extremely low, so show up to every class! Beware of epsilon-delta differentiability proofs - easily the hardest topic. (MATH 200 doesn't have it.) Midterm 1 was hard. Midterm 2 was BRUTAL. Barely finished although my pencil never stopped moving. Final was a piece of cake to make up for it. Course was NOT scaled much."
Izabella Laba ,3.0,3.0,A,I found the lectures a little dull. Prof Laba didn't always seem like she was interested in the material. Not a fantastic professor but it was never a negative experience going to class. Only 6 homeworks and they were pretty easy. Midterms were similar to practice ones and in the textbook
Izabella Laba ,1.0,4.0,N/A,"I took Math 226 with Dr. Laba, and it was not good. It is supposed to be an honours class, but she pretty much recites the textbook. She is not engaging at all, super boring. I ended up teaching myself most of the class because reading the textbook was better than attending class. One plus side was her grading criteria was clear."
Izabella Laba ,4.0,2.0,A,Very kind. Her marking is not tough at all. She gave me full marks for some answers that I didn't even do 100% correctly.
Izabella Laba ,5.0,1.0,A,"Provided very clear lectures and the coursework was similar to previous years, yet our section had a much higher mark for our average, showing the high level of professonalism that Professor Laba brought to Math 220."
Izabella Laba ,1.5,2.0,N/A,"Laba continually teaches as if the class is retarded. The entire course was a joke until it came time for the final - which had a pretty harsh marking scheme... Overall, I would say that she did not prepare the class for the final. (Class average on midterms: approx 80; assignments : probably >80; final class average: 70)"
Izabella Laba ,3.5,4.0,N/A,"She worked through examples in class, which helped, and lectures were quite easy to follow generally. There were only a handful of assignments, but they required a lot of thought. The midterms were straightforward."
Izabella Laba ,1.5,3.0,N/A,"I liked to secretly call her the snake. Cus she looked, moved and talked like one. Seemed to have learned to say the sound 's' by blowing through the gap in her teeth. I especially loved her bad jokes, example: after asking the class a question that no one answered she said we should all be lawyers"
Izabella Laba ,3.0,1.0,N/A,"She would suddenly stop teaching and ask us how to do the questions because she doesn't know how....-_-"""
Izabella Laba ,4.5,2.0,N/A,I took her class in 2002/2003. She is good at explaining things and solving problems clearly. She won't try to give students super hard questions to show off..She is good and nice!
Izabella Laba ,3.5,2.0,N/A,she is a nice prof.  if u r really persistent she will help you after class...otherwise she will tell u to try and think some more..she sort of gets impatient if u keep on goin unlike feldman n..  accent is ok...midterms easy...final tough
Izabella Laba ,3.5,1.0,N/A,"Accent a bit hard adjusting to, but easy exams...all the tricks are covered in class provided you listen..."
Richard Powers ,4.5,3.0,B+,One of the best prof at Rotman. Even after graduation I remembered his classes well. Very articulate guy with a great sense of humor. Sometimes attending his class makes me feel like I'm in court. Great experience!
Richard Powers ,1.0,5.0,N/A,I am not sure how this guy is even allowed to be in the classroom. 
Richard Powers ,2.5,4.0,N/A,"Popular because his lectures are hilarious, but you think he's great until he decides that it's your turn to be picked on. In short, a bit of a bully.  Also very unclear on grading criteria. Groups who made clear, concise, insightful presentations received the exact same grades as groups who went overtime and were all over the place. Unfathomable"
Richard Powers ,3.0,4.0,N/A,"He's not really a good prof, many thinks so (mostly girls).  But his marking is too tight.  Ego too big, respect girls more than guys.  Go to Shear's class, you'll do better in the exams."
Richard Powers ,4.0,3.0,N/A,Great Prof.
Richard Powers ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"A Great Prof all around, keeping school interesting and fun.  Witty Jokes, stories and bonus marks for 'rogues obscond'!  Good real life tips free of charge from a lawyer!"
Richard Powers ,2.0,3.0,N/A,he's egotistical and thinks he's hot****. not a bad teacher though.
Richard Powers ,2.0,4.0,N/A,"Expect a low B, no matter how hard you work, you're just gonna end up w/ that.  He loves putting ppl down and pick on ppl, especially if you are a guy."
Richard Powers ,4.5,1.0,N/A,"great prof... very approachable and willing to help! Uses great, real-life examples in class"

Elizabeth Legge ,4.0,2.0,N/A,One of the best lecturers and the most hilarious professor I've had at UofT! She's fairly easy-going and gave straightforward assignments (plus no final exam).
Elizabeth Legge ,4.5,4.0,N/A,"Wonderful professor. Goes on slight tangents, but is so bright and witty."
Elizabeth Legge ,5.0,2.0,N/A,I LOVE HER!!!
Elizabeth Legge ,4.5,1.0,N/A,"Easy: only evaluation was one essay per semester, with attendance and participation. Friendly and unintimidating (and liberal). Committed and knowledgeable. Didn't take notes, as we were not tested at all, it made it difficult to listen, and her talks were engrossing. Lots of class involvement, and was available outside of class for questions."
Elizabeth Legge ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"really giving, challenging"
Elizabeth Legge ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"That's just wrong. I took all the courses I could with Prof Legge. Funny, yes, but totally smart, challenging with theory and ideas, and really makes time for students."
Elizabeth Legge ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"An awesome professor. Incredibly witty, intelligent, humourous, honest, clear, and down-to-earth. She knows her stuff, and even more importantly, knows how to communicate it in an accessible, engaging way. She even managed to interest me in postmodernism, which is a feat not to be looked down upon."
Elizabeth Legge ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"she is freakin awesome! sooo funny and incredibly intelligent, i wish i could take every course with her!"
Elizabeth Legge ,4.5,2.0,N/A,very enthusiastic and interesting... she knows what she's talking about but doesn't talk down to students.  encouraging and willing to help.  excellent professor.

Elizabeth Legge ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"Attn: UofT Professors, take note from Professor Legge - one the best teachers in the world!  She is extremely helpful and always makes sure you understand.  She made class fun and you always wanted to be there!  She needs to win an award for being this good!"
Elizabeth Legge ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"Professor Legge was excellent. She was witty, intelligent, and poignant. As I was new to art history, she was willing to provide extra help. She was one of the best lecturers - never dull. She did, however, rush at the end of the course making it difficult to prepare for the final exam."
Elizabeth Legge ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"Professor Legge's lectures were well put together, they were funny, captivating and informative. Professor Legge seemed to know exactly what she was doing and only seemed scattered on the outside. She was always available to help and genuinely cared about her students. I hated modern art but after her class that changed, great class!"

Charlie Keil ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Professor Keil's lectures are funny, detailed, insightful and interesting but if you take his class I urge you to make use of office hours. I've never had a professor so eager to answer questions, assist students and expand on classwork. He is kind, respectful and so passionate about the subject - highly recommend."
Charlie Keil ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Prof. Keil's enthusiastic and passionate teaching style can make even the most dry subjects interesting. Great screenings, too- plenty of classics. His assignments in CIN201 might be a bit different than what a cinema student is used to, but he really goes out of his way to help his students. Great sense of humour, too!"
Charlie Keil ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Charlie Keil was the best professor I ever had! I can't say enough good things about him. He was so friendly, funny, intelligent, endearing, and always willing to help his students in any way he could. It was clear that he genuinely wanted us all to succeed and he was always there for us. Super interesting lecturer and fair assignments. Love him!!!"
Charlie Keil ,5.0,1.0,N/A,Only had Prof. Keil for  a couple weeks as he was filling in as a substitute during the strike. Despite this he was a fantastic addition to the course that livened up the room after having a not-so-interesting snobby graduate student teaching. Thumbs up!
Charlie Keil ,5.0,2.0,N/A,Going into university I had no idea what I wanted to take or wanted to do. I took his introduction to film course on a whim and he made me love in love with the art of film. I have found my passion and he fuelled my fire so pursue it. I love this prof.
Charlie Keil ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"BEST prof ever!! humorous, knowledgeable and handsome! love him <3"
Charlie Keil ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"Interested in what he taught, showed it to the students. Fun course"
Charlie Keil ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Brilliant professor. Clear, informative lectures on fairly complicated topics. Open to discussion on anything, and makes himself available for active dialogues with students outside the class. A good sense of humour doesn't hurt either, and a grammar stickler too. One of the best I've had all year."
Charlie Keil ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"It's been a few years since I took a class with Keil and I still find myself having flashbacks of it. Interesting, engaging, funny and as charming as they come. One of the best at the school, hands down."

Charlie Keil ,5.0,4.0,N/A,Amazing :)
Charlie Keil ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"Best prof I had all year. Despite always being slightly late, he knew his subject inside-out, and  his lectures were elucidating and enjoyable. Available for questions inside or out of class, and did not simply repeat himself in answering. Encouraged class involvement. Very funny."
Charlie Keil ,4.5,3.0,N/A,Funny
Charlie Keil ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"Very funny, and informative. Would love to take another class by him. Essentially did a 5 hour review for a final exam.. obviously loves what he does and is willing to go out of his way to help everyone out. A+"

Charlie Keil ,1.5,4.0,N/A,Not a very good prof...Says simple things in a complicated way which confuses most ppl....mid-term is not easy as not past tests are given....overall not an easy class in my opinion
Charlie Keil ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"One of the best professors at the school. Enthusiastic, knowledgeable and a great lecturer."
Charlie Keil ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"A pillar of the profession of teaching; this man leads this department with class and style.  Brilliant, approachable, insightful -- and most importantly, looks out for his students.  He transforms a mild interest in cinema studies into film majors and specialists.  He makes the driest material interesting.  Recommended above all others."

Manuela Gieri ,5.0,1.0,N/A,Gieri's Grrrreat!  Word.
Manuela Gieri ,2.5,4.0,N/A,Very nice lady but not a great prof. Her lectures were very monotonous and unorganized. She would just read from her typed notes and go off track dozens of times. Tests were very unpredictable. In order to get a decent mark you would have to memorize the entire 544 paged Bondanella bc you would never know what trivial question she would ask.
Manuela Gieri ,3.0,3.0,N/A,"Interesting lady, knows her stuff and is passionate about it. Her lectures however were very unfocused and tests had a lot of trivia that was not even discussed in class or even alluded to.
 Overall the course seemed very disorganized, but she is a pleasure to talk to outside the classroom."
Manuela Gieri ,5.0,1.0,N/A,Great Prof. she is extremely passionate about her course/subj. Is very helpful and understanding of her students. To people who comment on her constant ref to her son. That's a proud mom!!! Who would not be!!!Keep it up prof Gieri you are great!!!!

Manuela Gieri ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"The best professor I've ever had.  She's passionate, intelligent and extremely helpful."
Manuela Gieri ,2.0,3.0,N/A,"super nice lady, but an unfocused prof.  she monotoniously reads off a typed script for her lectures and often veers off topic during tutorials and lectures...usually about her kids and fellini whenever possible."
Manuela Gieri ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"Brava Gieri, Brava!!! What a great prof... although she is a bit eccentric, she can really liven up a class with her quirky sense of humour. She is extremely passionate about what she teaches, however, beware if you are not a Fellini fan!!    CIAO :)"
Manuela Gieri ,1.5,3.0,N/A,"A very nice person, but not the greatest professor."

P Rutherford ,1.0,4.0,A+,"HORRIBLE. I love Canadian history and he made me hate what he taught. If it was not for me teaching myself the topics through extra research, I would not have passes. He is very dry when it comes to his lectures. The assignments were very easy though. One thing he did well was assignments. "
P Rutherford ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"He does not use overheads, which makes his lectures a bit hard to structure in your notes. He also does not use online resources, which is frustrating. However, he is a classic prof: really intelligent, enthusiastic old guy who really knows his stuff. He speaks slowly and has a great lecture style. He was the reason I switched into History."
P Rutherford ,3.5,2.0,N/A,"Did not do too well in the class because I messed up on the exam, but the class itself was a good class.  The material was interesting and workload was light. You need to go to class and textbook reading is only required for the final. He doesnt use powerpoints so unfamiliar names and words can be tricks to spell. Overall a good class, but 4 hours"
P Rutherford ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"Sure the amount of reading was heavy - but it's a third-year history class, what did you expect? The quality of the readings are very high and manage to stimulate further thought and daily applicability. Rutherford has been teaching this course for years and knows his stuff! You may not get a 85 - but you'll get what you deserve, a thorough edu."
P Rutherford ,2.0,4.0,N/A,Rutherford is one of those profs at UofT who is determined to keep the class average low. I can't wait to see him retire.
P Rutherford ,3.0,4.0,N/A,"Lazy, but likable. Assigns an excessive number of textbooks (including at least one of his own); mid-terms are based on a complete reading of one, and the rest do not come into play until the final. Fine speaker; heavily supplements lectures with audiovisual aids. TAs do all the marking (you will not blow them away) but B, B+ is easily attainable."
P Rutherford ,1.5,5.0,N/A,"He doesn't explain enough in lectures, and expects you to write exam essays like take home exams.  Too theoretical and unreasonable marker.  Best not to take his classes if you need to get into grad school - you are not gonna get the grades you need from his classes."
P Rutherford ,2.0,2.0,N/A,"His course on approaches to social history is stimulating because he one of the few profs in the department who is interested in theory. Sadly, theory dates quickly, so it can all become a period piece. There is a lack of structure, but it can make you ask questions that are useful in research. But there is no rigour here."
P Rutherford ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"I don't know what everyone's talking about - Prof Rutherford is one of the best teachers I've ever had.  His lectures are really interesting and well prepared, he's open to comments and he's generous with his knowledge.  He also has a good sense of humour - I've never laughed so hard in a class.  His ads are a bit outdated, but carefully chosen."
P Rutherford ,4.0,4.0,N/A,"I enjoyed prof. Rutherford's courses very much:  bbviously, I took more than one.  I found the material both intersting and very challenging.  Lectures were celar and well communicated and discussions always stimulating.  Cutting edge readings and material.  I got a great letter of reference, but th"
P Rutherford ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"Great class. One of two professors I actually admire and who inspired me to dive into the material head-first...asking myself deep and thoughtful questions that had me thinking into the wee hours some days..arrogant yes, but that's what I love about him. At least he autographed his book for us!"
P Rutherford ,4.0,5.0,N/A,"Seemed arrogant, really just a typical eccentric prof.  Books were interesting, but useless until final exam.  Refused to write letter of reference for so-called ""unstellar"" performance (B+).  Very negative last impression of prof I started out"
P Rutherford ,4.0,4.0,N/A,"interesting material. kinda outdated with his videos and readings. the readings are VERY tough but interesting if you can get sense of them. didnt find him arrogant at all, actually quite approachable but a hard-ass about marks and inconsiderate abt marks"
P Rutherford ,1.5,4.0,N/A,"very lousy prof - course materials are years out of date (including his book, which you are forced to buy); no longer interested in teaching/research; ***IMPORTANT***: wrote undeserved negative reference letters for 4 of the top students in my class"
P Rutherford ,3.5,2.0,N/A,"i think his style of speaking just makes him seem arrogant, he wasn't mean or anything.  But he does come across as intimidating.  Good lectures, a lot of reading.  Definitely fair.  Can understand why people don't like him"

Kass Banning ,1.0,5.0,N/A,Never take her class I swear you will regret it. I've tried taking her classes twice and I dropped both because she is not a good prof. Shes a horrible professor and very hard marker. She thinks she can control people and uses her authority to do so. Dont leave the class to go to the washroom or come late or skip shell yell at you. Worst experience
Kass Banning ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Yes, her lectures are dense and her syllabus theory-heavy, but Kass Banning is a knowledgeable and engaging lecturer. She's also a kind, approachable person with a genuine investment in helping students learn and explore their own interests"
Kass Banning ,1.0,3.0,N/A,"Never ever take a course with Kass Banning. She made a remark about a student's mental health very lightly and was rude and disrespectful towards student contribution.

Also, she's extremely caring and helpful when it comes to papers - if you need help, ask for it! Her lectures are interesting and take from the readings quite a bit, she does an excellent job of summarizing."
Kass Banning ,3.0,3.0,N/A,"The course pack is interesting but her lectures are disorganized, she interrupts students, she doesn't clearly tie together readings+films+lectures and despite the class goal of countering eurocentrism she kinda falls into that trap sometimes."
Kass Banning ,1.5,3.0,N/A,Kass Banning is extremely disorganized in her lectures. She makes the students do useless presentations instead of actually teaching the course material herself as a professor should. She concerns herself more with asserting her power to fulfill her ego. Extremely  upsetting that such a person has hi-jacked all the upper year courses

Arthur Rubinoff ,3.0,4.0,A-,"Proper prof from the old school. Fair and knowledgeable. He'll call you out if you're just speaking for the sake of hearing yourself. Doesn't let students hijack lectures. Won't boost your grade just because you occasionally visit him during office hours. If you think he's mean or unfair, re-evaluate your idea of teaching  learning. "
Arthur Rubinoff ,1.5,3.0,A-,"The rudest, most uninspiring, bitter, and forlorn professor.  He seems to have an anger against the world.  He actually made a student cry in front of class once.  He did't hesitate to call students "" stupid "" or ask outright, "" How did you get into University ?! "".  Very dishevelled, looks **** all the time."
Arthur Rubinoff ,1.5,4.0,A-,"He mummbles a lot during his lectures, making it very difficult to understand what he is saying. I think he forgets we pay to take his class. He is extremely rude to students when there is no need for it- e.g. always wants students to ask questions, but responds rudely when they ask"
Arthur Rubinoff ,1.0,3.0,A-,"He mumbles about crap in his lectures.  He seems to be very angry, **** and disorganized all the time.  Does not know the meaning of "" human integrity "".  Once asked someone in front of class, "" How the hell did you get into University?"" and with that, I often wonder how the hell he got into the UNiversity bc he treats people inhumanely."
Arthur Rubinoff ,3.5,3.0,A-,"he's not that bad, and has a good heart. also very smart. the guy who says he's from harvard law, i don't believe you! how do you have enough time to cruise this site, lol... you don't have to lie: you can just say you think Art sucks"
Arthur Rubinoff ,3.5,3.0,A-,Great Prof.  I had him for international relations & american foreign policy.  He remembered me from my writing from the first course.  So don't think he doesn't know you.  Very strict in his classes but overall not a bad guy.
Arthur Rubinoff ,3.5,4.0,A-,"He's a good professor and knows a lot about the material he teaches. He seems strict and rude, but that's just his mannerism. He's not unreasonable, and his exams are straightforward. A lot of req'd reading, so be prepared to put in the effort and time."
Arthur Rubinoff ,1.0,5.0,A-,Terrible professor. The worst I ever had in university.
Arthur Rubinoff ,1.0,5.0,A-,"This guy is a clown of the highest order.  He once told me, my knowledge of American government would always be limited.  Now that I've graduated from Harvard Law School and am actively involved with the DNC in Washington, I guess we know who was wrong."

Victor Yu ,2.0,3.0,N/A,If you have the chance to take Murdock do it! She is harder but you actually learn the coursework properly. Yu teaches like you are 10 years old - he speaks slowly and keeps repeating the same content over - classes are a waste of time just read the textbook. Murdock sets the final exam and her testing is different so you will be screwed
Victor Yu ,2.0,4.0,N/A,"Kind of boring lecturer but the first couple of tests are easy and then it becomes really hard. First semester everyone wishes they had Yu, second semester everyone wishes they had Murdock bc you actually learned something and the exam is coming and Yu students are screwed ."
Victor Yu ,3.0,3.0,A,He is not a great lecturer but his tests are extremely easy. He uses a lot of questions from past tests that he posts.
Victor Yu ,3.0,3.0,N/A,"As a Rotman student, I really think it was a good idea to take ECO220 with Dr. Yu. His lectures are really dry but his tests are really fair and once you put in the work you'll perform pretty decently. It wasn't an easy course but it's doable."
Victor Yu ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"WORST Prof For ECO220. Very hard to follow in lectures, and questions appear on tests that were never covered in class (Especially those two last test which were literally IMPOSSIBLE) For Rotman Kids I regret not taking Murdoch She is the best prof for this course, has been teaching it for 10+ years and knows how to teach it plus she's very easy."
Victor Yu ,4.0,3.0,B+,"Made the mistake of assuming it was okay to not attend his class since he posts all of his lectures online. Did really well for the first 2 tests and messed up the last 2 because the concepts progressively got harder. Definitely do past tests, BUT GO TO CLASS TOO! He's a slow talker, but he's one of the only profs who actually cares about learning!"
Victor Yu ,5.0,3.0,A,"If you attended his lecture, you do not need to study at home, before the test you just need to do his past tests and you will get great grades.  His a pretty good professor."
Victor Yu ,5.0,3.0,B+,"he posts his lecture slides (which are really helpful!!) on bb, so that even if you miss the class, you can still catch up by reading his notes. love this prof!"
Victor Yu ,2.5,5.0,N/A,"Yu is speaks well and is quite clear. However, the text book is essentially useless since the questions are much easier than his test questions. It is best to study off his past tests and he usually recycles a few questions. One of my tests had no past test, so there was little to prepare us for it. Be warned, ECO227 is a very challenging course."
Victor Yu ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"Did not like him as a professor. Took ECMB11 course with him, and he decided to use a past FINAL exam for our second mid-term. I felt that doing this was un-fair. His notes are messy, hard to understand and using the textbook is absolutely useless."
Victor Yu ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"Excellent prof, love him!  Lectures are very clear and tests reflect lecture  material quite well. Don't bother with textbook, just do his past tests and you'll be fine. He recycles similar ""type"" of questions. One if the best profs I've had in 4 yrs  at uoft"
Victor Yu ,4.5,4.0,N/A,"Ok, the rumors about his tests are easy is not true. In fact if you wanna get high marks do NOT pick him. Let me tell you why. He seems to explain a lot of stuff during lecture very clear BUT he left out many complicated and important stuff which will be seen on the test. Too bad I didn't know that and I did poorly on my first test."

If you get to know him you'll find that he is actually a humble man who has respect for students so let's give him some credits here. Btw his CSC148 is the easiest so take his class if you can."
Jim Clarke ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"Professor Jim Clark was a very reasonable man.  If you present your case legibly, he will respond with great ease and understanding.

Jim Clarke ,1.0,5.0,N/A,I can't study this guy. He talks in such a small town accent I spent the first few weeks convincing myself he's a professor not some hick that found his way in Toronto. His lectures are so disorganized that I skipped them (as did most people).
Jim Clarke ,1.0,4.0,N/A,What a garbage professor. He can't communicate clearly with the students. He keeps on erasing his lecture notes on the board until you can't understand what he wrote or you're just to confused(can't even write straight).

Anna Bretscher ,4.5,3.0,A,A really nice prof.  Understands the the students situations and is willing to help her students out.    Has a sense of humor and hands out free food!

Her assignments are fair but 
Anna Bretscher ,5.0,2.0,A,"The new generation of professors have arrived.  Always goes the extra mile in helping her students.

A recent graduate, she understands what UofT CS students must go through."

Romuald Stanczak ,2.5,5.0,N/A,"Good sense of humour and he knew the material very well. However he was impossible to understand and his teaching method includes mostly formal math with very little explanation. This made MAT237, an already difficult course,  -extremely- difficult."
Romuald Stanczak ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"He's a very kind professor. He explains things well and is energetic, especially for his age. He even forced himself to teach while he was sick one time. He acted with dignity when the class was disrespectful. He knew his content well and did a good job explaining."

R Serbanescu ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"Ruxandra is an amazing professor! She is caring, her lectures are amazing, and all the assignments made sense. She made sure to answer all the questions she received and work on her lectures from these questions. However, her lectures were extremely fast-paced and that was a big shock in the beginning. The class was a breeze, though!"

 -responds extremely poorly to objections to his views
 -takes ages to grade anything
 -reads out of the book in class
 -forced our class to use gimmicky iclikers, despite almost unanimous objections"
Robin Marjoribanks ,3.0,4.0,N/A,"We did not get the midterm back until after the drop date had passed... in fact, we didn't get it back until today (last day of the semester) and we still haven't got the multi-choice part back, and the exam is 4 days ... not good.
 That's my only complaint, but it's a major one. Other than that, he is good and enthusiastic. Wants students to learn"
Robin Marjoribanks ,4.5,4.0,N/A,"Very Good Lecturer, very helpful in terms of helping students understand the material and the problem sets.  However, the problems sets are too long, and it takes him 3.5 weeks to mark our midterm.  He uses powerpoint in his lecture and many other software for students to understand the concept so they can see a picture. Great Professor overall."
Robin Marjoribanks ,1.5,4.0,N/A,No Comments
Robin Marjoribanks ,3.0,3.0,N/A,lectures were a waste of time. he spends his time telling anecdotes and giving excessive demonstrations
Robin Marjoribanks ,4.0,2.0,N/A,nice prof.final exam was ridiculously hard tho
Robin Marjoribanks ,4.5,4.0,A,"good prof. presents the material in a clear way. really cares about the students, and the fact they really learn and not just write tests. always ready to help, although really disorganized as a coordinator, although makes up for it by good lectures."
Robin Marjoribanks ,5.0,4.0,A,"Puts alot into lectures.  Cares whether students learn, not just get through.  Connects the material with other courses.  Asks a lot but gives a lot."
Robin Marjoribanks ,3.5,4.0,A,"Good lectures, although he often gets distracted telling stories. P.S., Robin, they aren't funny."
Robin Marjoribanks ,4.0,3.0,A,Decent prof. Assignments & midterm were fair.
Robin Marjoribanks ,4.0,4.0,A-,"he sticks to the book too much, there is no need to go to the lecture"
Robin Marjoribanks ,2.0,5.0,A-,"Great speaker, jokes alot, but doesn't help much at all."
Robin Marjoribanks ,4.5,4.0,A-,"Great lecturer, however he has no concept of how long assigned tasks may take."

Martin Wall ,5.0,1.0,N/A,Professor Wall is Wonderful!
Martin Wall ,3.5,4.0,N/A,"Marty Wall is really knowledgeable and explains difficult concepts well. Tests could seem intimidating at first, but all the questions are actually fair and are based on material from the textbook. The prof/TAs are approachable after class, but not so much during the online tutorial sessions. You should do really well if you have a good memory."
Martin Wall ,5.0,3.0,N/A,Amazing Professor.  Very engaging.
Martin Wall ,3.0,3.0,N/A,Martin (Marty) Wall is an amazing professor.
Martin Wall ,4.0,2.0,N/A,hottie
Martin Wall ,2.5,5.0,N/A,"Terrible course. Even if you were a good student in High School, U of T Arts and Science will crush you. It's VERY Competitive here. Avoid U of T Arts and Science under all circumstances. This prof's Psych exams were soooo hard!!!! Especially the writing part."
Martin Wall ,5.0,3.0,N/A,My favourite Prof of my entire degree.
Martin Wall ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"He's a great teacher, very clear, and able to keep a class in con hall interesting, which isn't easy. The tests are fair, not hard. Some people simply confuse psychology and sociology coming out of high school and think you have to know nothing about the brain! He sends you a nice letter if you're doing well."
Martin Wall ,1.5,5.0,N/A,nice guy but hard
Martin Wall ,3.0,4.0,N/A,"Pretty good prof.  He was hard, but if you knew the material you'd get a good mark."
Martin Wall ,2.0,5.0,N/A,He made you hate psychology.
Martin Wall ,3.5,5.0,N/A,Dont take that course. Just don't. It's only Psych. Its not worth going through the trouble. Reallly tough and you need to know how to write big answers. His multiple choice were tricky but still doable.
Martin Wall ,3.0,4.0,N/A,Very interesting material and he is so funny and entertaining to watch some days. But he was very very tough on the exams.
Martin Wall ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Incredible lecturer. Makes the hours fly by, and then he's available to chat and answer questions  afterwards. My favorite prof at U of T so far."
Martin Wall ,5.0,5.0,N/A,Amazing Prof.
Martin Wall ,3.0,4.0,N/A,No Comments
Martin Wall ,5.0,4.0,N/A,The best Prof ever!
Martin Wall ,1.0,4.0,N/A,"He's so vague! Really bad prof, wastes a lot of time."
Martin Wall ,5.0,2.0,N/A,PSY100 was my favorite course in first year. Professor Wall did an amazing job expanding on the textbook material and making the concepts interesting and applicable to everyday life. He and this course inspired me to go on further in psychology. Best prof I've had so far!!
Martin Wall ,3.0,3.0,N/A,"Wall is great. He is very interested and enthusiastic about the material. Lectures were always enjoyable, however, almost the entire test covered material from the textbook. You are expected to memorize the text quite a bit."
Jack Carr ,5.0,3.0,N/A,Texts were completely ignored and in fact a distraction.  Lectures were great!
Jack Carr ,3.5,3.0,N/A,I think he is one of the best profs i came across at UofT. He took a lot of interest in teaching us and was very adaptable to all kind of questions. Yes he has a similar kind of testing method but prior preparation is must to do well. Recommended 100% not sure tho if he is still teaching.
Jack Carr ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"One of the best profs. NOT because he's easy, but character. Used to work for US government, smart guy but humble about it,doesn't act like it. Funny person and it's not artificial sense of humour; he's just a funny person! He's retiring soon; I suggest you take a course with him before you regret. Highly recommend, no regrets, wish him the best."
Jack Carr ,1.0,5.0,N/A,horrible Prof. Dont bother going to class.. just rad the text book.
Jack Carr ,3.5,4.0,N/A,nice prof but hard test
Jack Carr ,2.0,3.0,N/A,you'll never be able to understand what he writes and draws. carr's hands are as crippled as they get.
Jack Carr ,2.5,3.0,N/A,"He's a really nice guy and puts in a lot of effort into answering questions. However, his notes are not very clear and sometimes  incomplete. He's not the most organized professor, but he still makes Economics really interesting and applies it to everyday life which is kind of refreshing."
Jack Carr ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"Very experienced professor, he got his PhD since 1971, long time, loved how he applied economic concept into real life, interesting to go to his class, one of my best prof in 1st year."
Jack Carr ,4.0,4.0,N/A,"Great prof, able to make dry material interesting. He hums and haws a bit, but is a brilliant professor. Make sure to ask him any questions you have, he is great and will answer all questions he can during lecture. Carr is top notch!!"
Jack Carr ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"He is a really good prof, those who only desire a simple introduction to economic should definitely take the course."
Jack Carr ,1.0,5.0,N/A,sb
Jack Carr ,3.5,2.0,N/A,"Prof Carr was by far my  best professor in first year. If anyone can make economics interesting, accessible, and still manage to take questions in a class of 500 they are a fine prof in my books. Keep it going Jack, You are an AMAZING prof. To those who say he is hard, go to class more often."
Jack Carr ,1.0,3.0,N/A,"the TA is mean, he marks our tests meanly...he likes to give 0 to everybody. carr is friendly and approchable but he doesn't explain clearly. You can hardly understand his lecture if you don't read the textbook although it's hard to read and useless."
Jack Carr ,1.0,5.0,N/A,Prof Carr was very ineffective. The midterms happen to usually focus on certain chapters-no balance at all. This led to very low marks & bell-curves took place. The final exam was much easier than the 2 midterms. The grading is very heavy -2 midterms: 25% each & final exam: 50%. Definetly keep in mind the course evaluation.I would not recommend him
Jack Carr ,4.5,3.0,N/A,No Comments
Jack Carr ,5.0,1.0,N/A,he is the best prof. in using bell curve.
Jack Carr ,5.0,3.0,N/A,this guys the best!
Jack Carr ,4.0,2.0,N/A,"NICE PROFESSOR, EASY TESTS BUT A  VERY HARD EXAM...MY MARK DROPPED FROM 87 TO 70 ..."
Jack Carr ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"Although Professor Carr's notes was a little messey, specially during the last five minutes, he explained and communicated very well. His wisdom, knowledge and teaching skills showed every lecture. Also even with the large class, he went out of his way to answer the students questions weather during or after class. So far the best prof I had!"
Jack Carr ,4.0,2.0,N/A,"Intelligent, interesting, engaging.  Generally very understandable.  Be warned though: Let's just say he's a little more Stephen Harper than Jack Layton.  ""If you love trees use more paper"" - that was my favourite."
Bob Jefferies ,5.0,3.0,N/A,Great Prof. Will always be remembered. RIP.
Bob Jefferies ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"jefferies is an amazing prof, sweet as hell and really understands his students. he offers alot of extra tutorial sessions. he talks slower which is AWESOME since u have time to copy down everything and UNDERSTAND it all. tests are fair, however you do have to know your stuff...especially for term test 4, since the material is really dense."
Bob Jefferies ,3.0,3.0,N/A,"This prof talks so slowly, I sometimes wonder if time itself has slowed down just because I have stepped into the biology lecture hall. It's not that he's a bad lecturer in explaining his material -- it's just that his monotone voice, and extremely slow speech makes you want to sleep... very, very badly."
Bob Jefferies ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"Probably one of the best prof in BIO150. Lectures tend to be short (about 30 slides), and he explains things very clearly and slowly for each slide so you can copy down everything he says. Approachable and helpful; for our class, he gave tutorial/extra help sessions 2 to 3 times a week."
Bob Jefferies ,5.0,1.0,N/A,Very clear but very slow talker...dont be fooled tho! he jumps though the material kinda fast.
Bob Jefferies ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"Great prof, spoke slowly which made taking notes easy as was previously mentioned,was very clear, and repeated himself alot, prevented me from missing anything, reminds me of my nice grandfather"
Bob Jefferies ,5.0,3.0,B,love his British accent
Bob Jefferies ,3.5,3.0,B,"Very clear, somewhat boring. I slept in most of his lectures. Not completly his fault though, I've slept in most BIO 150 letures. Probably the lighting."
Bob Jefferies ,1.5,4.0,B,This was the worst prof of the course. He has a terrible lecture style and nobody understood what he was saying. I don't understand why he got such a good rating I am totally shocked. His tests are not so terrible but he is so boring it is almost surreal.
Bob Jefferies ,4.0,2.0,B,he seems like a cool guy...one of those cute old people lol i dunno hes nice enough but he can get repetitive sometimes...hes alright in my books
Bob Jefferies ,4.5,3.0,B,"lectures were wonderful. unit started slowly and required reading was longer than with the other profs, but this was necessary for the material being taught. clear and concise. very fair test."
Bob Jefferies ,5.0,2.0,B,Informative lectures; interesting material
Bob Jefferies ,5.0,2.0,B,"Jefferies was a bit of a slow talker which was good because note taking was very easy.  Test was amazing, all I can say is PRACTICE THE OLD TESTS because that is where most of his test questions come from!"
Bob Jefferies ,5.0,2.0,B,Excellent Professor. Really helpful with his week round tutorials. Made Biology more interesting.
Bob Jefferies ,5.0,3.0,B,like a storyteller with a nice english accent ... liked his lectures the most in this BIO150 course
Bob Jefferies ,5.0,4.0,B,"Really nice style, like listening to a storyteller. Slow pace is good for note-taking, doesn't use unnecessary slides. Very personable. Test not great, but not awful."
Bob Jefferies ,5.0,3.0,B,"like my grandpa! Although talks very slow, he's really really good.  Very clear and thorough at explaining everything."
Bob Jefferies ,5.0,3.0,B,"i respect jefferies alot....like he's daily tutorials are amazing and really helpful...i was kinda annoyed by his slow pace and repetitiveness, but i guess it's a more better learning style..i love what he's teaching"
Bob Jefferies ,4.0,3.0,B,Good prof ... reminds me of my grandfather ... I actually think he wants to teach us something ... but wait he might think that we're idiots by the slowness and the ever so repetitiveness of his words ... or even maybe he might hate all 1st yrs and want t
Bob Jefferies ,4.0,3.0,N/A,he warned us of his slow talking pace at the beginning...but i never imagined it to be THIS slow..and repetitive!
Danny Goldstick ,3.0,4.0,B-,"He is a very nice and understanding guy, and he's incredibly smart -- but I found this to be a weakness because he was not able to bring it down a notch to your level, or at least my level . The readings were okay, not Incredibly difficult but not easy either. He is inspiring, got me to do some readings on Marx which I found enriching. Tough grader"
Danny Goldstick ,4.0,4.0,N/A,"The trouble is that he's one of those brilliant people who doesn't realize how brilliant he is, compared to most of the rest of us. He's difficult to follow simply because he's speaking at a higher level. This doesn't make for a great teacher, but it's not because he's doddering or unfocused."
Danny Goldstick ,5.0,4.0,A,"I took Marx and Marxism and Advanced Topics in Epistemology with Danny. I would say that all of the negative comments on here are accurate. However, he is a truly EXCELLENT analytical philosopher with very well worked out arguments and positions. If you do the work to learn from him it is enormously valuable. Also his tech illiteracy is amusing"
Danny Goldstick ,3.5,4.0,N/A,He really takes the time to talk to you. Approach him outside of class during his office hours.
Danny Goldstick ,4.0,3.0,N/A,on Israel but it takes courage to be so firm on issue. And to you backbiters: watch him and maybe you?ll learn a thing or two.
Danny Goldstick ,4.0,3.0,N/A,Professor Goldstick is not only one of the friendliest profs in the department but he is also one of the few people I have met that pursues social justice with out pomp or pretension. It takes a lot of courage to be a communist in a department run by wealthy white people that most of which have not thought twice about the men
Danny Goldstick ,1.5,4.0,N/A,"Caused me to drop the course. I love Ethics, and this was my chance to take a seminar, but it was impossible to understand what he was trying to teach. He really ought to retire."
Danny Goldstick ,2.0,3.0,N/A,"The WORST professor at UofT. Do not take PHL317!! He needs to retire!!! The readings were useless, the class was unorganized, the lectures were boring, and he would go on tangents that had NOTHING to do with the material. Some questions on the exam had NOTHING to do with the material in lectures. This class was a waste of my time."
Danny Goldstick ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"Dr. Goldstick is friendly, if doddering, but his teaching methods seem disorganized, and the content seems dogmatic. When asking questions of him students sometimes doubted if he heard them properly, but he would steamroller along with his own conclusions. Some people seem to really like him as a teacher though."
Danny Goldstick ,3.5,4.0,N/A,"Danny Goldstick is a great prof and a great guy.  Although he can be tangential and slightly disorganized, he is a wealth of philsophical knowledge.  He is down to earth and friendly, and is always willing to help students on a one on one basis. He will get to know you and he truly cares about his students."
Danny Goldstick ,3.0,4.0,N/A,Delightful
Danny Goldstick ,3.5,3.0,N/A,"Probably the funniest and most energetic prof I have ever encountered.  Yes, there are many moments where you have no clue what is going on. However, if you read and interest yourself with Dialectics, Marxism etc, his Socratic approach becomes very useful. Unlike most professors, he wants you to challange him. He provides a choice-essay or exam."
Danny Goldstick ,3.0,3.0,N/A,He is the worst professor I've ever had. He should not be teaching an undergraduate course because he cannot bring his teaching down to an undergraduate level. This course is the most frustrating course I've ever taken.
Danny Goldstick ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"totally accommodating and understanding. definitely student oriented. impossible to get a hold of at off times since he has no email/website, but his happy demeanor more than makes up for it. a little confusing/nonsensical at times, but its more like an endearing grandfather."
Danny Goldstick ,3.5,2.0,N/A,"Great guy, really interesting, but he can be difficult to get a straight answer out of because he likes to equivocate. Worth the effort to tease the meaning out of some of his statements"
Danny Goldstick ,1.5,3.0,N/A,"worst class i ever took. a smart man who should stick to writing books instead of confusing students with completely nonsensical ramblings in something so close to orwellean double speak, that almost all assertions were given in the form of a sarcastic question. brutal."
Danny Goldstick ,2.5,4.0,A,"Goldstick was somewhat unorganized in lectures, yet the points he made were very thought provoking.  Though frustrating at times do to its abstract material, this class was still enjoyable of you put in the effort and had an open mind."
Danny Goldstick ,4.5,2.0,A,"It's true, he is kind of doddereing and set in his ways, BUT he is without question the prof most willing to spend time with/on students.  If you are seriously intested in Marx, or want to argue for hours about mind-body determinism, you can do no better."
Danny Goldstick ,3.0,3.0,A,Exceptionally student centred
Danny Goldstick ,1.0,1.0,A,one of the single worst experiences I had. A waste of time
Leonard Priestley ,4.0,5.0,A+,"Professor Priestley gave me a purpose and, identity at the  University of Toronto. Now so many years later, I am a professor too! Thank you for inspiring me Professor Priestley! "
Leonard Priestley ,5.0,3.0,A+,"I recorded all his classes.  I heard legends of his class, and I and so glad that I was able to take his class.  Book early for this class.  He teaches very difficult material well.  This was my favorite class and teacher during my undergrad."
Leonard Priestley ,4.5,1.0,A+,"once you get past his no-eyelash stare, you love him.  he's funny, calm, brilliant.  and his class will prolly change your life.  NEVER sell your copy of Chuangtzu, you'll regret it."
Leonard Priestley ,5.0,3.0,A+,"I'm now a graduate student, which means I've almost been in university for 10 years, and I dont think I've had a better prof: he embodies the best of what you'd want in a teacher."
Leonard Priestley ,4.5,3.0,A+,The best class I've had in my life!! An extremely enriching class taught by an excellent instructor! Felt almost enlightened myself after this class!!
Leonard Priestley ,5.0,2.0,A+,"i took this course with priestley over 4 yrs ago, changed my outlook on life."
Leonard Priestley ,5.0,2.0,A+,"such presence...one could hear a pin drop, no due dates, great email response ra"
Leonard Priestley ,5.0,3.0,A+,An amazing teacher! One of the best at UofT!
Leonard Priestley ,4.5,3.0,A+,the legend has brought many insight into Eastern phil. Reason to B at UT
Leonard Priestley ,5.0,2.0,A+,This prtofessor is amazing and compassionate. The best at UoT!
Leonard Priestley ,3.5,2.0,A+,A very friendly and enlightening man.  He was a wonderful teacher!
Joseph Goering ,3.5,3.0,N/A,"He is probably the best and easiest to understand of the three. the only thing is, the course was sort of dry"
Joseph Goering ,5.0,1.0,N/A,He has rudimentary knowledge of Hebrew.
Joseph Goering ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"probably the best professor at u of t, if not the world."
Joseph Goering ,4.0,4.0,N/A,"Very nice prof! His lectures were probably the clearest of the 3 profs teaching this course. Little jokes here and there were helpful to liven it up a bit. I really liked his lectures. Once he led my tutorial group, and was helpful in answering some questions and provoking thought."
Joseph Goering ,5.0,3.0,N/A,Best professor of all time.
Joseph Goering ,4.5,3.0,N/A,He is AWESOME!
Joseph Goering ,3.0,3.0,N/A,"A very pleasant man, funny, and friendly. Class however seems to have no direction. Great person, not the most fruitful instructor."
Joseph Goering ,4.0,4.0,N/A,"One of the best profs at u of t, period. His smc 210 course made me decide to do a minor in medieval studies. Equally excellent in HIS 220. I recommend that anyone remotely interested in the period take SMC 210. One of the top 3 courses I took during 5 years of humanities studies."
Joseph Goering ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"Excellent lecturer, he appears to drift and get off topic at times but if you are really paying any attention you find it all relates. His best attribute is his ability to let a student raise a point and if that point is incorrect he guides the student to the correct conclusion with gentle suggestions. Overall one of my top 5 profs!"
Joseph Goering ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Fascinating lectures, appealing as a person."
Joseph Goering ,5.0,3.0,N/A,Best prof ever.
Joseph Goering ,4.5,4.0,N/A,"A very interesting prof, with some very cool theories. Not your average outlook on medieval life, very unusual. Readings are a must, and every class is on the test, so even if it is a slideshow take notes!"
Joseph Goering ,3.5,3.0,N/A,"He is a good teacher.  His knowledge about the medieval time period is unbelievable.  I agree that he was the best of the three profs in this class.  He and Cochelin were both good teachers, but his English is better.  He isn't really easy for note-taking, but that's okay.  He gets distracted a lot, but it's always interesting.  Great monk haircut."
Joseph Goering ,4.5,4.0,N/A,"HIS220 is taught by three profs, Goering is the best by far. One doesn't speak English all that well, the other mumbles. All know their stuff, but Goerings the clearest and most enjoyable. Great intro to medieaval history."
Joseph Goering ,2.5,3.0,N/A,"Seems like a nice guy, but that doesn't justify his style.  Came closest to giving a chronological history, but then destroyed it with randomness.  Seems unable to flesh out ideas.  Enjoyable enough to listen to, though."
Joseph Goering ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"Fun, sweet, intelligent guy. Loved his ""three part opera"" theory about the middle ages. Best prof of the three by FAR."
Joseph Goering ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"The best of the three profs teaching this class.  Clear, funny, and engaging.  Map drawings show incomprehensible artistic skill. :)"
Joseph Goering ,5.0,1.0,N/A,Very clear lecturer.  He made everything go together so well and laid things out perfectly for notes.  Really a great guy :D!
Joseph Goering ,4.0,2.0,N/A,"Very amusing prof, and also VERY clear. Made perfect sense of medieval history. Worth listening to. Love his map drawings-useful, but will definitely disqualify him from the fine arts faculty. :)"
Joseph Goering ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"unorthodox style of teaching takes a bit of getting used to, but is good once you do.  gives very kind assurances and follows through.  very nice guy!"
Konrad Eisenbichler ,5.0,3.0,A-,So passionate and knowledgable about what he teaches. His lectures are always interesting and you leave each one with new fun facts. He can be a little blunt and old school but means well and has a great sense of humor. All of his classes are great but Sex and Gender is one of if not the best class I took at U of T.
Konrad Eisenbichler ,5.0,3.0,B,"Konrad was a funny, caring professor. He really took the time to get to know his students and their names (which is not that easy to do). His lectures were informative and engaging. The exam was pretty straightforward because he brings in sample questions to help with studying (some end up on the final). Very little readings!"
Konrad Eisenbichler ,5.0,2.0,N/A,Really friendly and makes his lectures informative and interesting!
Konrad Eisenbichler ,3.5,3.0,N/A,"VIC343Y1Y was one of my favorite courses ever.  Believe it's been squeezed into a full credit for the second term.. (i.e. Y1H at UT).  Shame, deserves the whole year.  Love his work on the Farnese family, assigned his own article but it was entertaining on point and I will never look at cod pieces in the same manner.  Never saw him ""pick"" on anyone"
Konrad Eisenbichler ,1.5,3.0,N/A,"Arrogant and extremely rude, not to me personally but I've seen him be a total... to someone else!"
Konrad Eisenbichler ,4.0,1.0,N/A,"For a course that I wasn't terribly excited about, he really changed my perception. His discussions about the works were very engaging - he clearly knew his stuff and shared it in a humorous way. Assignments were easy and the material interesting. The final test requires a bit too much memorization, but overall it's a small nitpick. Great course."
Konrad Eisenbichler ,5.0,2.0,N/A,Amazing professor. I wish he taught more courses.
Konrad Eisenbichler ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"Prof Eisenbichler is the best! He is the nicest, most amazing person ever! Sadly, didn't get to take a class with him but had a chance to work with him! Everyone should be so lucky!"
Konrad Eisenbichler ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"I had eisenbichler for Sex and Gender and he is amazing! Gets to the point and analyzes all his sources quickly...Exteremely smart...and his ""cutting-up"" of your paper is actually helpful...i havent had any TA's or profs mark my papers the way he has...he actually shows you what you did wrong...and as for pickign on people in class NEVER"
Konrad Eisenbichler ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"As a Renaissance Studies student, this is my second class with Professor Eisenbichler!  He's the real deal - a brilliant scholar, a gifted writer and a superb teacher.  He explains complex concepts in a way that makes them easy to comprehend.  The other class he does is Vic 440 and I highly recommend that one too!"
Konrad Eisenbichler ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"By far, the best professor I've ever had.  A pleasure to be in his class"
Konrad Eisenbichler ,2.0,1.0,N/A,"Although knowledgeable, he is rude and clearly has trouble with English at times mocking students for using words ""incorrectly"", when he doesn't understand them himself. Totally disorganized course pack and his 'discussion' is often one-sided. Nice enough but completely arrogant."
Konrad Eisenbichler ,5.0,1.0,N/A,One of the best professors I've ever had. He is always ready to listen to students ideas and discuss them. He is very open minded. And he's got a great sense of humour.
Konrad Eisenbichler ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"Eisenbichler is great professionally cuz he is concise, and explains concepts using examples we can relate to. He has a tendency to speak harshly towards those who don't agree with him. I rec him but I advise those who have him in e future to keep standing their ground & to speak their mind. That's the reason why we're in class in the first place:)"
Konrad Eisenbichler ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"I admit, after reading these reviews, I was leery about him. However, after meeting him, I found that he was extremely approachable. When I asked for help with sources for an essay or presentation, Eisenbichler had some great suggestions and lent students books and papers from his personal collection. He also has an... interesting sense of humour."
Konrad Eisenbichler ,5.0,3.0,A,very engaged and offered help without judgement
Konrad Eisenbichler ,2.5,4.0,A,"This man is a terrible professor. For his classes, he makes a list of students to pick on and will continually insult them right to the last day of the year. I will give him credit for his knowledge however given that he has edited several book on mannerism's, it is shocking that the subject has never rubbed off on him.  Avoid him if you can."
Konrad Eisenbichler ,5.0,1.0,A,A very knowledgeable person but I had friends who were very disappointed by his picking on them for no reason. Has a lot to work on (personality) otherwise his courses are very interesting.
Konrad Eisenbichler ,5.0,4.0,A,"I can't complain because I did well, but other in my class had their essays torn apart and made examples of. Very embrassing. So as for a marker, you definitely have to work hard to get the grades. As for teaching, very good lecturer, very smart, and makes note-taking easy. Also good with extensions"
Konrad Eisenbichler ,5.0,1.0,A,Excellent
Jill Tate ,5.0,2.0,A+,She is a very nice lady but she is retiring soon. Great lectures and easy exams.
Jill Tate ,5.0,3.0,A,DO THE WEEKLY HOMEWORK easy way to boost your grade. Term test 1 is very easy and will get harder from there. take advantage of this and get a high grade on the first test because most of its review from high school. The content doesn't go far beyond integrals. classes can be boring bc Jill only walks through examples from the textbook
Jill Tate ,5.0,2.0,A+,"Prof. Tate is very nice. Her lecture notes are very clear and easy to understand. She also does a lot of examples step-by-step, which makes it easy to follow. I found the review sessions very helpful as well. I'm not very good at math but with some effort, I was able to do well."
Jill Tate ,5.0,2.0,A+,SHE IS SOOO NICE!!!
Jill Tate ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Good prof, explains well"
Jill Tate ,5.0,3.0,N/A,She's great! Lectures are very clear and she is always available for questions during class. Definitely recommend.
Jill Tate ,5.0,3.0,A+,She's such a kind woman and genuinely cares for her students. She's always telling us tricks to do on tests and what questions may come up. If you have a question she extends her office hours and really wants to answer it to make sure you fully understand it. She's one of the best profs here but she's really underrated. I fully adore this woman.
Jill Tate ,5.0,3.0,A,"Best prof for mat133! Take it with her, go to her test review sessions, and do past tests, and youre guaranteed to pass! Also very approachable for any questions you may have during/before lectures!"
Jill Tate ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"Loved Professor Tate. Go to class, do the homework and you're guaranteed a good mark."
Jill Tate ,4.0,3.0,A,Great for Matt133. Really good at explaining and doing examples. She is definately for the students- if you know what I mean- teaches us how to pass. Like odds are he's gunna put this on the exam so make sure etc. She made a cheat sheet with all the formulas at the end no other prof did that. She's great- despite the 3hr lectures.
Jill Tate ,5.0,2.0,A+,"4th year student here. Lemme tell you; there is not a single day in my 2nd, 3rd and 4th year where i don't think about Jill. I have never had a single prof that's has more charisma, experience, and glow. I wish i could go back in time and sit through just ONE MORE mat133 lecture with her. Truly an exceptional lady; shaped who I am today."
Jill Tate ,4.0,3.0,A,"Jill Tate is a very kind and caring woman. She really cares for her students and hopes for all of them to do well. She always has review lectures the week before a test/exam, which really helps as she takes up past exam questions which can come up on the coming test! If you have to take MAT133, take it with her, those 3hr lectures are worth it!"
Jill Tate ,3.0,4.0,N/A,"She teaches well and all, but its probably because of her sessions being 3 hours straight, it is really easy for her to lose us in her lecture, and she tends to assume we know a lot of fundamentals and skips steps at times. She assumes we all did our homework so she does not really explain her examples too clearly."
Jill Tate ,5.0,3.0,N/A,Professor Tate is really a good math teacher and her mind is so clear. She usually teaches the methods of a topic first and then accompanied with lots of exercises. Her class is the most effective lecture I've ever attend and she holds review session before every term test or final exam. Choose her lecture and trust me you won't regret :)
Jill Tate ,5.0,3.0,N/A,Professor Tate explains the concepts so clearly and does alot of practice questions in class. Maybe not the most fun class (3 hours of math just isn't fun) but she's definitely a prof to consider. Choose her whether you're weak or strong in math.
Jill Tate ,5.0,3.0,B,"She was really nice and explained every concept very clear. She was just like a high school teacher, go through every question step by step. Really like her."
Jill Tate ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"I was in her Monday 6-9pm class and I often stay after to ask her questions. She was always patient with me and made sure all of my questions were solved, even tho it's super late already, she's amazing!"
Jill Tate ,5.0,2.0,A,She's an amazing prof and explains all the material in a way for everyone to understand. She gives lots of examples in class and also will always answer any questions people have.
Jill Tate ,5.0,2.0,A,"Best professor to teach this course. Anyone who has her has a great chance of getting an A in her class due to the clarity of her teaching. Took this course with a different prof in the 1st sem and was almost failing; then switched my section to her class and got perfect on my final. Amazing, really want her to teach my other courses"
Jill Tate ,5.0,1.0,A+,"Not to be mean but in all honesty if anyone gave this course an easiness score under '4' then they are legitimately and by definition retarded. I'm sorry I sound mean but this course is already a joke in itself and then Tate made it like 20x easier. So seriously, delete those easiness scores and give AT LEAST a 5...- UTFA"
Mark Kingwell ,1.0,3.0,A,"Was one of the worst classes I've taken because of the prof. After attending the lectures figured out that he wasn't a good lecturer ( and talks about himself way to much). The one thing that bothered me the most is that he didn't give marks in percentage (he just marks it as A or B), which made it difficult to know what the final mark is gonna be"
Mark Kingwell ,1.0,4.0,N/A,A good talker. But as a prof. He is limited. Should be sent off like a monastic scribe to read and research. Thats what hes best at. Be ready for exam that has 8 percent to do with what he actually babbles about. Avoid. Not worth it as an undergrad prof.
Mark Kingwell ,5.0,4.0,A,"super cool, 217 had lots of reading but Kingwell brought it altogether so well, like a KING, welllllllll, anywayyyyyys, take it"
Mark Kingwell ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"You get a lot out of his class, but only if you do the readings (and the readings are substantial - a (short?) novel per week). And it's absolutely worth it. Assignments are also super fun, though you do need to put in the work!"
Mark Kingwell ,5.0,3.0,A-,"His knowledge on literature is endless. Seriously. I bet you could name any novel and he will know exactly what you are talking about, plus a full biography of the author. Brilliant prof, and he makes classes beyond entertaining. I looked forward to the seminar every week. You MUST read the books assigned BUT they were unfailingly enjoyable!"
Mark Kingwell ,2.0,4.0,N/A,"His exam was so bizarre! He told us what he'll test us on mostly, but included maybe 2 terms and 8 other terms that we barely/never discussed in class. There's a lot of reading to do (finish one PHL book every week). Also, the TAs were not helpful at all bc the TAs and Kingwell fought (?), but this wasn't even clarified in class."
Mark Kingwell ,2.0,5.0,N/A,"Made TA's hate him so much in the first month that they went on work to rule. Came under review for having too much material in the course so he had to change the syllabus - because of this he made a lot of readings ""optional"", but relied on them heavily (so, they weren't really optional). Insanely hard. Impossible to follow along. Don't do it."
Mark Kingwell ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"Kingwell is very passionate about the material he teaches and it shows in his lectures and the way he presents the material. He makes sure to distinguish between his own interpretation of the material, what the philosopher may have intended, and what others have said to avoid bias. His lectures are funny and he is very approachable."
Mark Kingwell ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Keeps your attention, good sense of humor, casual"
Mark Kingwell ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"Kingwell's lectures were engaging. However, this ""survey"" course ended up being too crowded, and as a result, became superficial (most of the information we learned could've been learned by going on wikipedia). That was  a shame, as Professor Kingwell is probably one of the most knowledgeable people on the subject. He tried to do too much. "
Mark Kingwell ,4.0,4.0,N/A,"Clear lectures, but not thorough. That is, he did not cover works extensively, but instead, gave overall pictures.   I managed to end the course with an 87, but the final examination seemed like it was recycling questions from his Aesthetics exam. Some concepts were only mentioned in passing, but still appeared on the exam. Great lecturer though."
Mark Kingwell ,3.0,4.0,N/A,"Would take again, and again, and again."
Mark Kingwell ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"HOT, KOOL, 1ST KLASS GUY, MAKES U THINK, BEST EVR!!!!"
Mark Kingwell ,2.5,4.0,N/A,The lectures are superficial.
Mark Kingwell ,3.0,5.0,N/A,Kingwell is very insightful if you really pay attention. His class can get really boring though. He also doesn't use powerpoints so you better make sure you attend every class and take good notes! The guest speakers were the highlight of this course. The essays were difficult and so was the grading. Overall an enlightening experience in aesthetics.
Mark Kingwell ,2.5,4.0,N/A,"Very little relevance between assigned readings and lectures. Made his own book mandatory reading and then did not discuss it all. Can be an engaging lecturer, although seems uninterested most of the time."
Mark Kingwell ,3.0,3.0,N/A,"It was okay I guess... not a huge fan, especially with a 6-8 page essay + review that had to be written within a week..."
Mark Kingwell ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"I completely agree with what a previous commenter posted: he is crystal clear if you pay good attention to what he is saying. What he says is not only clear but very, very insightful for someone just stepping into philosophy!"
Mark Kingwell ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"Fantastic! I love him, I love him, I love him. One of my role models."
Mark Kingwell ,4.5,4.0,N/A,"Kingwell was dope. He's got class and finesse ? he doesn't lecture, he performs. I understand he's very sought after, both in the university and in broader academia. Couldn't recommend him more highly."
Abdel-Khalig Ali ,5.0,4.0,A+,"If you want to learn Arabic, Professor Ali is the best prof out there. The language is difficult, but Prof. Ali really cares about his students and takes time to explain hard concepts, over and over if necessary. He is a kind and caring person and he makes sure his students are well prepared before tests. If you put in the work, you'll be rewarded."
Abdel-Khalig Ali ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"The kindest prof at UofT and definitely the kindest prof I've experienced so far at University. If you truly have an interest in learning Arabic, this is the prof to go to. He continuously goes the extra mile to help his students. Highly recommend!"
Abdel-Khalig Ali ,5.0,4.0,B+,"Took his class a few years ago, seriously one of the best profs I've had. Cares about his students and passionate about Arabic. Gives a lot of homework though."
Abdel-Khalig Ali ,5.0,4.0,A,"The best professor I've had at UofT. Nice, caring, and he really loves what he does. If you do the work you can't go wrong. Amazing professor!"
Abdel-Khalig Ali ,5.0,1.0,N/A,He is an amazing professor. Always there when you need him. Can't make it to class? Email him and you'll get the most friendly response you have ever gotten. #respect
Abdel-Khalig Ali ,5.0,1.0,N/A,3 3 Best professor at UofT!
Abdel-Khalig Ali ,5.0,1.0,A-,Love this man! Always there to help the students who show interest in class.
Abdel-Khalig Ali ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"Love him! A great professor, so kind and ready to help. Do the work in class and you'll get the most out of it. He explains things very well. I would definitely take his class again."
Abdel-Khalig Ali ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"Ali was a great prof, and I purposely changed around my schedule in order to have him as a prof again. If you know what you're doing because you put in an effort and are interested in the course, Ali will do anything to help you. His logic- ""if you think my course is worth the effort, you're worth the effort."" So slackers and texters- watch out."
Abdel-Khalig Ali ,5.0,2.0,N/A,I've had Dr Ali for 3 years now. If you want to learn Arabic I absolutely recommend him. He is fantastic. I have nothing bad to say about him.
Abdel-Khalig Ali ,5.0,3.0,N/A,Amazing prof! Just do your work and be prepared and the rest is easy!
Abdel-Khalig Ali ,4.5,2.0,N/A,Awesome prof.
Abdel-Khalig Ali ,5.0,5.0,N/A,WOW I had intro arabic wuth him and man he explains the language in a way that you will fall in love with Arabic even if ur not majoring in linguistics! He is strict and serious but I didnt have any problems with him however some people had issues with him (just do ur work and dont ask stupid Qs) I found him really helpful and knowledgeable
Abdel-Khalig Ali ,5.0,3.0,N/A,AMAZING; if you truly want to learn from a linguist you should take his class. He will teach you to create sounds you never thought you could do without an accent... worth all the work. A GREAT experience; he's an awesome professor who truly cares to make his students understand the concepts of the course material
Abdel-Khalig Ali ,4.0,2.0,N/A,pretty solid!
Abdel-Khalig Ali ,4.0,3.0,N/A,i took lin100 last year. the course was very interesting. he is very enthusiastic and clearly explains quite difficult concepts.
Abdel-Khalig Ali ,5.0,5.0,N/A,"A great teacher, but very strict. If you take any class with him, make sure to work hard and ALWAYS keep up with your homework."
Abdel-Khalig Ali ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"A briliant teacher. Pushes students hard to study, and prepares the classes exceedingly well to support students through their learning process. If you are serious about learning, take his courses."
Abdel-Khalig Ali ,5.0,2.0,N/A,One of the best profs in uoft!!
Abdel-Khalig Ali ,2.0,3.0,N/A,lots of hand gestures
Matt Price ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"One of the most friendly teachers in this university, very approachable. If the course materials are not attractive enough for you, attend the lectures anyway for his personality. His lectures are also very helpful for understanding the materials. He is also a lenient grader."
Matt Price ,5.0,3.0,A,"If Price had a podcast, I'd subscribe. The guy clearly loves what he does, and that translates into his work. Yeah, as some have noted he doesn't dumb it down if you approach him, but he's not at all condescending. To me it feels like Price both wants you to learn, and then actually *care* about what you've learned."
Matt Price ,3.0,4.0,B+,"He had interesting ideas and seemed like a nice person. Friendly enough, but seemed a bit stubborn. He seemed to know what he was talking about & went out of his way to help people. Only real complaint was his tendency to interrupt when you were doing a presentation and speak for ten to twenty minutes about a topic not really related to your speech"
Matt Price ,1.5,3.0,A-,"Terrible professor.  Can never finish his lectures and isn't a clear speaker.  He is also kind of a jerk when approached.  Thankfully, you can cover the entire course by spending the weekend on wikipedia (would have been nice to have been challenged and inspired by the professor).  Class is a waste of money/time but an easy half credit."
Matt Price ,4.0,2.0,A,"If you're interested in the future directions of the field of history, take this course. This course introduces students to digital history while also letting them gain some technical skills. Matt is a supportive and attentive instructor. This is good if programming isn't your forte.  Attendance is mandatory, as it's a seminar course"
Matt Price ,5.0,1.0,N/A,Engaging and brilliant professor. Focused and exact. 
Matt Price ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"This course attempts to give humanities students technical programming skills, which is something generally unfamiliar to humanities students. Matt is a helpful and supportive instructor; even if you struggling with the technical assignments, he is always glad to help you. Attendance and participation s are a must, as this is a seminar course."
Matt Price ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"THE most worthwhile course I have taken in my university career. I came out of the course with skills...skills that with more work I can put out there on the market. Yes, he may be scatterbrained but he is absolutely brilliant. He wanted us to succeed, and gave us the confidence to. An awesome person and an awesome teacher."
Matt Price ,4.5,4.0,N/A,"He was brilliant!  The kinds of ideas he was able to integrate into the course material stunned me, and I appreciated how much he tried to engage each and everyone of us.  No prof has ever shown that kind of interst in their students in my experience."
Matt Price ,1.0,3.0,N/A,Disorganized. Loses his train of thought. Boring lecture. Was always late. I eventually stopped going to the lecture because he was not engaging at all. Tutorials is what saved me. Overall would not recommend the class with him teaching it.
Matt Price ,3.5,4.0,N/A,"I was so pleassantly surprised with this class. Yes, it was difficult, yes Matt is a little disorganized. But if you are a history student you can value and appreciate his brilliance, his ability to integrate simple things such as lullibies into his lectures, and his amazing ability to engage and intrest the student in his lectures."
Matt Price ,1.0,4.0,N/A,"He seems rude, snobby, and really disorganized.  His lectures are all over the place, he loses his train of thought frequently, and is late all the time.  I hated this class because of him. He looks like he is having a mental breakdown every class."
Matt Price ,3.0,3.0,N/A,"Decent Prof.  Not the best I've had- like others have said, he is always very fantic and disorganized- but he did seem like a nice guy, and when he did start his leactures, they were pretty good."
Matt Price ,3.0,1.0,N/A,"Wow. I really didn't like this guy. I thought he was a little snotty, and frankly, his lectures didn't offer me any more information than I already knew. The first tutorial reading assignment was a joke. He treats his students like they know nothing about research. At the very least, this comes in handy when exams are marked..."
Matt Price ,3.0,4.0,N/A,Weird teaching style. Your expected to discover arguments yourself instead of being told like most courses i.e you better have a stable background in 19th century history when he's teaching
Matt Price ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Each lecture focused on a certain theme rather than being a chronological description of the events. So his lectures were very interesting, not just repeats of the textbook."
Matt Price ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Disorganized lectures were fun, his jokes were funny, the readings were relevent and tutorials were engaging. One of the best history courses I have taken, and I hope to get Matt Price again. Excellent Prof, try to get him."
Matt Price ,3.0,2.0,N/A,"Readings and insightful tutorial questions much appreciated. Online readings, although interesting, were inconvenient. While lecturing, tended to rush through lectures after frequent organizational difficulties."
Matt Price ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"Great Prof, really energetic and smart. Really passionate about history. If you take the time to talk to him during office hours, extremely nice and genuinely caring. A little skatterbrained (lectures were always rushed, but kinda fun that way!)  take this course if you can."
Matt Price ,2.5,3.0,N/A,"Not a good lecturer. Knows his stuff, but scatter brained. The course was good except for the lectures which were often confusing and went off-topic."
Debra Sibbald ,1.0,5.0,A+,"decides to teach against guidelines while using guidelines as readings trash tier prof, worst one of the semester and likely the year"
Debra Sibbald ,3.0,5.0,N/A,"She is very knowledgeable & that is exactly the issue. She cannot comprehend that some students do not remember everything she has said in the class. She is so smart, that cannot understand it takes time for students to digest the amount of material she covers in a short period of time. Just listen to her, learn everything she says, & memorize!"
Debra Sibbald ,2.0,5.0,N/A,You want to teach a course to a pharmacist without teaching about treatments? Don't.
Debra Sibbald ,1.0,5.0,N/A,Contradictory information.
Debra Sibbald ,1.5,4.0,N/A,The content itself is interesting and important. Her teaching method is bizarre and leaves most of the class confused and lacking on information. She tries to get you do work things out without showing/teaching it in the first place. Care plan? No one knows how to write one and shes never given us one example. Needs TEACH us not mess with us.
Debra Sibbald ,1.0,4.0,N/A,This is the right course taught by the wrong person.
Debra Sibbald ,1.0,4.0,N/A,"The class itself is the most importnat one in second year. But deborah's ""teaching"" method leaves smething to be desired. She attempts to make you beleive she is your friend, but her temper often dissolves this guise!"
Debra Sibbald ,1.0,3.0,N/A,"EXTREMELY difficult to deal with.  She insists on complicating EVERY aspect of the course with her anal retentiveness.  The subject matter is rather interesting, but she just takes all the fun out of it..."
Debra Sibbald ,3.0,3.0,N/A,"not hot, and definitely boring and very sickly.....peace out"
Ronnie de Sousa ,4.0,4.0,N/A,"Ronnie is overall a very pleasant professor to have and you know that he cares about the material he is teaching, especially those subject matters relating to sex... yeah... He's a bit quirky, and sometimes rambles, but overall provides a good introduction into philosophy. Go to tutorial and lecture, or have fun burying your head in books."
Ronnie de Sousa ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"His lectures are amazing and hilarious! He made 3 hour long night lectures so easy to deal with, his jokes and ideas really grab your attention. The assignments are pretty straight forward, but he does grade pretty hard, so definitely put in some work or take it as an elective to CR/NCR"
Ronnie de Sousa ,4.0,2.0,A+,Talks really slowly but other than that he is great. His understanding of logical principles within philosophy is what makes him so great as he is able to understand questions and arguments and properly answer them. It seems that he truly does care about the success of his students as well.
Ronnie de Sousa ,5.0,4.0,B+,"Ronnie is an absolute beauty.. lectures were always entertaining and assignments were interesting and complex. Marking is generous if you work hard. This course is rewarding and you will get out of it what you put in. Attend lectures, do readings, and make sure you take time on assignments.. BEAUTY"
Ronnie de Sousa ,4.0,4.0,B+,"The best part about Ronnie's classes were his anecdotes about his youth, mostly about sex or drugs, but honestly, he is a real good philosopher and usually makes the dense reading material more clear in lecture."
Ronnie de Sousa ,5.0,3.0,A,"Incredible lecturer, to the point where I suspect he was a stage actor previously. The British accent helps. He goes into decent depth on all topics surveyed, though referring to the original texts is very much necessary for a grade over a B-. His passion for the subject comes across very clearly."
Ronnie de Sousa ,4.0,4.0,A-,"An awesome professor, especially in a field with such difficult concepts! He's older and has an uncensored sense of humour, which is hilarious. Attending lectures is important, as the material in the texts you use definitely requires explanation in-class. The exam questions are given before the exam. Get TA advice before submitting each paper!"
Ronnie de Sousa ,3.0,4.0,N/A,Professor gives too much reading. It is extremely hard to get a good grade.
Ronnie de Sousa ,5.0,4.0,A-,"Good lecturer, nice guy. He does grade quite harshly and can be a little unpredictable. Its a relatively tough course but definitely a fun one."
Ronnie de Sousa ,5.0,4.0,B,Prof. De Sousa is simply brilliant. One of the most intelligent and educated people I've met. His lectures are interesting and well-structured. He is also very funny and swears a lot (the latter wouldn't work for anyone) which adds to his charm. Attendance is not mandatory but recommended since his explanations are very clear and thorough. He rocks
Ronnie de Sousa ,5.0,4.0,B,Favourite prof at U of T so far. Tough grader but you're going to have to take a hard course eventually.
Ronnie de Sousa ,5.0,4.0,N/A,good professor
Ronnie de Sousa ,4.0,4.0,A-,"Although the class itself isn't necessarily easy, professor de Sousa makes it more manageable and is super interesting."
Ronnie de Sousa ,3.0,3.0,N/A,"His lectures are pretty passionate and he's hilarious. Never went to him for help, I just went and saw my ta, but he has office hours during project and exam time. "
Ronnie de Sousa ,2.5,4.0,N/A,"Posts lecture slides, but highly recommend going to lectures - he's a fantastic speaker and he really will lay out the content of the slide clearly. It will make sense if you pay attention.  Do the readings, and show up to lectures, and you'll be just fine. "
Ronnie de Sousa ,1.0,5.0,C+,"His lectures were boring, and they were very hard to for me to follow. His marking is incredibly hard, and sometimes his lectures were seemed irrelevant. I wanted to like him, but he I just could't seem to. However, I talked to many people that liked him, and his teaching style. It's just a personal preference thing. "
Ronnie de Sousa ,3.0,5.0,N/A,"Ronnie gave long, dry lectures about interesting material. He often cared more about sounding smart than actually teaching his students. As a first year student, we covered an excessive amount of readings and philosophers, and the assignments were tough. Tutorials saved me!"
Ronnie de Sousa ,4.5,5.0,N/A,Fun and interesting Prof. I nearly dropped his course due to the first assignment being painfully difficult but persevered. After doing it I'm pretty sure it was purposely like that to sort the wheat from the chaff as the rest was a breeze. Marking is very fair and his lectures prepare you significantly for the final exam. Recommend.
Ronnie de Sousa ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"I love Ronnie so much. He's my favorite professor ever. Super helpful, super hilarious, and just overall super amazing. The way he talks is so distinctive, I can listen to him talk forever. Yeah he may be biased, but his opinions are worth listening to. If I could, I would take this course over and over and over again. "
Ronnie de Sousa ,1.0,4.0,N/A,"the worst professor I have ever had after 4+ years studying philosophy. Totally unclear. Terrible slides, and unorganized lectures. He brought in SO MUCH useless jargon and useless diversions. It almost seemed like he was showing off how much he knew instead of teaching a course. His presentation of the categorical imperative was embarrassing!!!!!!"
Paul Kergin ,1.0,4.0,N/A,"Professor Kergin is a poor lecturer. He speaks in monotone and is constantly coughing during lecture - as he smokes before class. He makes mistakes on the board and is not helpful with questions. You'd be much better off avoiding him. The grades are consistent across sections, however, since this is a Rotman-required first year class."
Paul Kergin ,3.5,4.0,N/A,He is a very good person but just that he's too old to teach and his class is very monotonous and boring..                                 You tend to lose out on concentration in his class
Paul Kergin ,4.0,1.0,N/A,"Term tests are a breeze, averages in the high 70s. Exam brings the average back down to C+ but very simple with studying. Easy A+"
Paul Kergin ,5.0,1.0,N/A,Nice guy. Easy class. Haters gonna hate.
Paul Kergin ,5.0,1.0,N/A,I like him. He's nice and explains things well. I don't understand the extreme negativity in the comments!
Paul Kergin ,3.0,3.0,N/A,"His lectures are useless. I always skip them. I never look at his notes to study for tests. The book always makes concepts easier than he ever could. He is a nice guy though, and he only makes sense when you ask for help from him personally."
Paul Kergin ,1.5,2.0,N/A,"He's not a very good professor. Yes he keeps wearing the same white/blue striped shirt to class and coughs like a million times each class. Not very helpful, his notes suck and he frequently makes mistakes while teaching. I'd suggest going to Tate's lectures."
Paul Kergin ,1.0,1.0,N/A,"I was laughing my head off when looking at those comments.. He is gross, yes. He wears the same cloth every single day and sometimes he even stinks.. lol It seems like he washes his hair once a week..(though he's almost bald..)His course is the easiest of all courses I took in this university for 4 years. This course should be taught in highschool."
Paul Kergin ,5.0,3.0,N/A,The guy is absolutely gross. The same clothes every single lecture. And how he brings his notes in an LCBO bag. And the terrible coughing fits he has from his chronic smoking addition. But once you look past that this guy is an awesome professor. I was thinking about dropping first day but I’m glad I didn’t. Thanks to this guy I’m getting mid 90s.
Paul Kergin ,1.5,3.0,N/A,"I would agree with the rest of the other comments. He has a monotone voice which usually makes you sleep in class. Your better off going to Tate's class for better notes and explanations. How hard are the tests? Just do past exams and learn some of the concepts in the Supplementary Pkg/text. Don't rely on his lecture notes, make your own."
Paul Kergin ,1.5,3.0,N/A,"he totally sucks, dont think anyone will like to take his course...having his lects is wasting my time~"
Paul Kergin ,1.0,4.0,N/A,"Pretty horrible prof, most one the most dull person i've ever met seen in my life, rambles on and on to himself in class, no one really understand a word he's saying, his notes does not help pass igelfiend's test"
Paul Kergin ,2.5,2.0,N/A,I got a better mark not going to lectures and learning on my own. I'm sure he's really nice...I feel sorry for him! As much as i agree with all the previous comments
Paul Kergin ,1.0,3.0,N/A,He is an example of how not to dress and take care of yourself but no doubt saves a lot of money. I just wonder at night where it all goes lmao.
Paul Kergin ,3.5,2.0,N/A,he's a good prof. and his tests are pretty easy... especially if u do past tests... he rambles on sometimes... if u do ur work and practive old exams ull get an A ... he's much much better than igelfeld..
Paul Kergin ,2.0,2.0,N/A,"The course was easy, but it has nothing to do with the prof~ he can perhaps teach, but overall~ He is not helpful at all~ Learning from the textbook is much more effective"
Paul Kergin ,2.0,3.0,N/A,Repeats himself endlessly & doesn't make sense. Once spent 5 mins writing out example source. Does not prepare notes very well so gets confused & can't find mistake. Unclear and skips steps. Test questions don’t make sense. When approached is very defensi
Paul Kergin ,1.0,5.0,N/A,No Comments
Paul Kergin ,2.0,4.0,N/A,his lessons r pointless.
Paul Kergin ,2.0,3.0,N/A,"Spends eternity talking about an example but due to incoherent rambling and over analyizing the question on hand, he ends up being unclear and confusing. This course isn't hard but the exam is worth a whopping 60% of the course mark."
Roy Baker ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Best professor at UofT.. The exam was easy if you knew your stuff, but it was definitely fair. No one said UofT was easy. Suck it up or back yo bags."
Roy Baker ,5.0,4.0,N/A,Dr. Baker is just an adorable old man. And he's hilarious. He clearly knows metabolism well and is enthusiastic about it. People who complain about his teaching style and questions should remember that this is METABOLISM. Knowing the pathways and cycles is basic. He's super creative with his analogies and his test questions were fair and creative.
Roy Baker ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"An amazing professor, the material taught was directly on the test as long as you kept up with it, and drew those damn structures EVERY DAY. For an hour a day you put into this class, its a 4.0 you would get out."
Roy Baker ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"Course needs to be brought into the 21st century.  Memorizing a million details from a book is NOT contructive (profs should read papers by piaget, gardner, etc. on teaching theory)"
Roy Baker ,1.5,5.0,N/A,This course is like any other U of T Science course.  The content is ok but the tests have nothing to do with lecture/text/notes/tutorial.  There really needs to be more accountablility with respect to this... the prof is ok.. I liked his analogies
Roy Baker ,1.0,5.0,N/A,tests do not match course content
Roy Baker ,4.5,5.0,N/A,"possibly the best lecturer in the course, highly creative questions on test...."
Roy Baker ,4.0,5.0,N/A,very funny!
Roy Baker ,5.0,2.0,N/A,the best course in university. his tests are challenging BUT his lectures make it worth all the trouble!
Roy Baker ,2.5,5.0,N/A,it is almost impossible to understand how his questions come from his lectures
Roy Baker ,3.0,3.0,N/A,:(
Roy Baker ,5.0,4.0,N/A,one of the best
Roy Baker ,4.5,5.0,N/A,"I think he's the only professor who can actually make biochemistry fun, although he made us pay for his ""fun lessons"" with his super texas-chainsaw-masscre-like exam... So, you should either study til the cows come home, or take this course in the summer.  Still, a great prof, though."
Roy Baker ,4.0,5.0,N/A,"Sure he teaches ok, but come on...doesn't Cousin Nimmo eventually get on your mind? Plus, that exam was stupid..tested on itsy bitsy details that didn't ask for understanding but was made to kill. Overall, I was not impressed ..he definitely needs to take courses on how to write fair tests."
Roy Baker ,5.0,5.0,N/A,"He is a superb professor. His way of teaching is simply brilliant. His lectures are super interesting and packed(I mean PACKED)with materials. I think he's a genius. That being said, his test is SUPER HARD. Beware."
Roy Baker ,1.5,5.0,N/A,"I simply hate him.His analogies are redundant and an  insult to my intelligence. Like other UfT profs, he does not teach, he banters on and on. He should be fired."
Roy Baker ,4.5,5.0,A+,"He is really good at presenting the content of the course. Makes it enjoyable, interesting, and understandable. His analagies can be a stretch at time but sometimes they are very effective. His test questions are very difficult though!...Overall his classes are well organized and informative."
Roy Baker ,4.0,1.0,A+,"Profs don't get much better than this.  The guy has won awards for his teaching, and you're definetly not bored to death by his lectures.  The material is hard, and he can't really do anything about it except make the classes enjoyable, which is a BIG HELP!!"
Roy Baker ,1.0,5.0,A+,"of all the courses i took this year, this was the 2nd most painful to sit through.  the lectures were extremely boring, even more so than our textbook (which was a huge waste of money).  mr. baker was totally disorganized.  all in all, a horrible experience."

George Grantham ,2.5,3.0,N/A,"Had him long ago.  He was late to every class. Midterm grade was strangely low. He said - You didn't submit your paper...I said...yes, I did... and it is lying on the floor under your desk with a bunch of others.  He had to add about 40 points to my grade.  And adjust for all the others he had dropped on the floor.  Self-centered. Oddly arrogant."
George Grantham ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"my favourite prof at mcgill!  very helpful, really knows his stuff.  i suggest this class to any econ major that wants to take a break from really mathematical and dry theory classes."
George Grantham ,2.0,4.0,N/A,Yawn.... attended class a few times but learned close to nothing. I taught myself the textbook instead.
George Grantham ,1.0,4.0,N/A,a very poor prof to say the least; can be unduly rude in person; very impatient if you disagree with him - even on academic issues; at times a very bitter man
George Grantham ,4.0,1.0,N/A,"I've taken his class three times now.  Best class in economics.  Hopefully I will get him one more time before he graduates.  Don't bother with the readings, they are never on the exam."
George Grantham ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"Boring? Yes. But this guy knows his stuff and his lectures are pretty useful. His Final Exam however was not in the traditional Econ format, however it was fairly straightforward for those who studied and didn't cram the information in at the last minute."
George Grantham ,1.0,3.0,N/A,"For this class (econ) 209 the proffessor just seems like he does not care, he is always late, talks about the topics as though people actually memorized the text, plus you'll be stuck with short answer questions on the final versus all other sections who have multiple choice. Finally, this teacher talks as though he has crackers in his mouth"
George Grantham ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"One of the best profs I've had at McGill. He is so smart, handsome, verry funny and witty, and everything he says in class is meaningful. For this class, I didn't even buy the book, but went to classes everyday and took good notes. Do this and you'll be fine!"
George Grantham ,2.5,2.0,N/A,I went to four classes: the first two of the semester and the two quizzes we had. I didn't find the lectures helpful. Study the book and do lots of exercised and you'll be fine.
George Grantham ,3.5,2.0,N/A,"Great prof to go to with questions/requests for advice, which is sorely needed at McGill.  So even though his lectures can be all over the place remember he is pretty nice if you talk to him, but keep in mind he can be a bit blunt."
George Grantham ,2.5,4.0,N/A,"one of these guys who was an anti-social nerd in high school who now finally has to learn how to interact with other human beings...at your expense. though the prof.'s a genius, don't go to lectures. the exams are pretty random but somehow you don't fail. study like it's your job and forget lectures."
George Grantham ,2.0,3.0,N/A,"Unhelpful Prof; isn't a good teacher and can't maintain a focused lecture. While ocassionally kind, he can be very odd in one-on-one discussions."
George Grantham ,2.5,2.0,N/A,"terrible at equations, but very fair exam. Overall nice prof, fair grading, but his lectures are unbearable especially for the math part."
George Grantham ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"Really nice guy, helpful if you go to see him, but he tends to go off on tangents in class and expects a lot of you for the final exam."
George Grantham ,4.0,4.0,N/A,"While lectures were not his strongest point, Grantham gave lots of time in office hours and really helped me improve my writing style.  Really nice and helpful guy, with lots to say, just be sure to excuse yourself if you need to go."
George Grantham ,3.5,3.0,N/A,"Pretty nice guy.  Course isn't that interesting, but he sure does know his stuff."
George Grantham ,1.5,4.0,N/A,He is a very smart and interesting person. He can't teach and his lectures are read. He doesn't answer your questions rather answers his own.
George Grantham ,1.0,4.0,N/A,"horrible prof. AVOID HIS COURSES. superficially nice guy, but can't teach to save his life; will shaft you (grade wise) if you disagree with him regarding anything significant"
George Grantham ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"very interesting, hard tough (as you would expect from an honour course)."
George Grantham ,1.5,5.0,N/A,avoid if possible
Storrs McCall ,5.0,3.0,N/A,Based old man. Smart as a whip. My second favourite philosophy prof. His seminars were always a highlight of my day.
Storrs McCall ,5.0,3.0,B+,"The seminar I took with Dr. McCall (Topics in Philosophy) was a delightful class. The topic discussed was decision-makingi.e. themes of deliberation and determinism. He is brilliant, humble, and endearing in a grandfatherly way.  I always left his class inspired and cheerful."
Storrs McCall ,4.0,2.0,N/A,"Professor McCall is a charming old man (late 80s) who's been doing philosophy for ages. I had him in a very small class (15 people) on a subject which he loves (Time). At this very personal level, he was extremely friendly. His marking is very fair if you show the slightest interest in his work. Take a class with him before he retires!"
Storrs McCall ,4.0,2.0,N/A,"Phil of Law with Storrs was fun! The concepts were really interesting and there was barely any theory involved, just a lot of talk about real life examples and hypotheticals. The papers were interesting and marked fairly."
Storrs McCall ,4.0,2.0,N/A,"You need to take this man before he retires finally. Go to lectures, don't screw around on your laptop, and listen to his lecture, it's worth it. He is in his late 80s, has been doing this course for literally decades, but is still incredibly passionate, which will rub off on you. Standing ovation at the end of the last lecture."
Storrs McCall ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"Storrs McCall is a fantastic professor, brilliant intellectual, and a great man. The class is very interesting and he has a way of engaging the class in discussion."
Storrs McCall ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"He's really good at explaining the book, and that's really helpful because the books that we read for this class were not the easiest (Plato and Descartes, especially). Having a nice TA matters 'cause TAs grade your paper."
Storrs McCall ,2.5,4.0,N/A,"McCall is hilarious - keep track of his comments cause he's so funny ... but in terms of lecturing, he tends to talk in circles for most of the class about one vague point so you tend to zone in and out of paying attention. He's super sweet though, awesome prof. TA's mark hard at first, but they easy up as the term goes by."
Storrs McCall ,4.0,2.0,N/A,"storrs is easily the best philosophy prof i have ever had. such a cute old grandfatherly figure. i looked forward to his class each day. work load really isnt that challenging.. just four short papers. TAs are fairly tough at first, but once you know what they want its much easier"
Storrs McCall ,3.0,2.0,N/A,"no use in going to class, he just explains everything from the books. go to class for a fun time though, cuz storrs is the boss. he will give extremely clear examples so id you read something and don't get it, just go and it'll all make sense. don't challenge him, he's always right. very light work, only 4 essays and an exam."
Storrs McCall ,5.0,2.0,N/A,The most attractive man I have ever met. His intellect is something we can only aspire to.
Storrs McCall ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"Most adorable old man ever - spent class wishing he was my grandfather and restraining myself from getting up and hugging him! It really is story time with Storrs. Take this class before he retires, but to be honest you might find the readings a bit confusing if philosophy isn't your cup of tea."
Storrs McCall ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"McCall is the cutest old man alive. Each class is like story time! He's so nice and clear in lectures. I'm going to miss him so much! Class is not hard if you attend lectures and read the material. Four essays, 500 words, 15% each + Final exam. Not hard for a first year class but lots of reading! But it was all worth it for McCall!"
Storrs McCall ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"this class got me through first semester. he's so entertaining, going to miss him! i hope he knows he has inspired many of his students!"
Storrs McCall ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"Storrs is a sweet, adorable, old man, but this class is VERY basic. It is actually quite boring. The readings are easy and he goes over them in detail. He isn't responsive to objections though...Michel-Antoine Xhignesse better be your TA! He's hilarious and EXTREMELY helpful- a stickler for structure, but actually goes over the material in depth."
Storrs McCall ,2.5,4.0,N/A,Hard but awesome
Storrs McCall ,2.0,4.0,N/A,"Storrs is a cool guy, too bad he doesn't run the class. TAs are horrible and you will want to stab yourself during every conference. They are incredibly boring and the essays are marked without mercy. I advice you not to take the class. Join some reading group at your local library and you will probably learn the same amount."
Storrs McCall ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"Probably the most learned man I ever met at McGill - a pleasure to attend his class. He made philosophy interesting, but sometimes what he says can go way over my head. Take his course though, the final is easy if you study hard for it."
Storrs McCall ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Fantastic Prof, fantastic course.  I'm actually sad that it's over.  Take it."
Storrs McCall ,4.0,4.0,N/A,"He is the JEWEL of McGill!!! If you are at McGill, and at least somewhat interested in Philosophy, seriously consider it. One of the very few profs at McGill that you actually sense fine wisdom without being intimidated. Lectures can be intense and papers can be difficult to grasp! (experience can be exponentially enhanced by choosing S/U option)"
Sonia Lupien ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"Brilliant, funny, cynical. Critical towards news, research, what she teaches and how she teaches : open-minded and energetic, she gives a demanding but excessively rewarding class. Naysayers will mistake her recent or unconventional data for factual mistakes : please be smarter than that."
Sonia Lupien ,4.0,2.0,N/A,"Pr.Lupien is very dynamic and clear in her explanations of the materials.She has her own ways to explain certain concepts that you may find very helpful.Her playfulness is nice but maybe towards the end a little over the top. Other than that, she is very approachable and overall it is a pleasure to go to class.Watch out for the group project though"
Sonia Lupien ,1.0,2.0,N/A,"I had a BIG problem with Prof Lupien. She said things that were incorrect in many of the lectures. She ACTUALLY said that neurotransmitters travel in vesicles after they are released!  If you took any physio course you will be angered by her mistakes, otherwise you won't know the difference. Easy A either way, no need to think..."
Sonia Lupien ,4.0,3.0,N/A,the class is really interesting and she explains things well. her assignment isnt explained well though..the TA was really helpful as well(Rok!).the first month is very scientific but the next 2 months are the interesting parts so if u could get through the first month youll be fine
Sonia Lupien ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"It's really too bad she doesn't teach more classes. Absolutely wonderful teacher. Her explanations are clear, fun, and up to date. She has a true passion for teaching as well as for the material she teaches."
Sonia Lupien ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"Honest to goodness, take this course. Always interesting and stimulating. Dr. Lupien is clear, energetic and has a way of making everything interesting. Best course I have taken so far."
Sonia Lupien ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"it really does seem like the best class in Mcgill! If it doesn't seem like this in the beginning, it will definetly seem like it in the end of the course and even after the course. You will be sitting in your other courses and wishing for DR Lupien to be your teacher: yes she is that good! Bonus: TA"
Sonia Lupien ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"wonderful professor. highly demanding, but it pays off. i loved that she expected creative thinking and more than just regurgitation."
Sonia Lupien ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"wow what a class
 non cumulative exam but actually forced to think and understand instead of regergitate 100 multiple choice
 interesting material all great teacher
 probably my fav class at mcgill so far 
 highly recomended for anyone"
Sonia Lupien ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"Don't know if this matters but Lupien is freaking gorgeous. She gets my testosterone going so much, it shuts down my HPG axis. If I were a woman, I'd have an LH/FSH surge all over her. She's like Celine Dion but: a) HOT b) not old c) SMART and d) FINE"
Sonia Lupien ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"I didn't realize how much I took away from this course until after I took it.  Lupien stresses critical thinking from all aspects...and that has not only helped me in my psyc and science courses, but it's helping in all aspects of my life. GREAT course!!"
Sonia Lupien ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Very interesting teacher. Knows how to grab student's attention and hold it for the duration of the class. Hard exams, but worth studying for. Celine Dion should be proud to have a resemblane to such a cool prof;)"
Sonia Lupien ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"Really engaging, really funny. Pretty tough but refreshing to listen to."

Christopher Green ,4.0,3.0,A-,"Chris Green is a great professor, whose only downfalls are that he's pretty advanced in age. His voice is a bit weak, and some of his presentations are outdated. That said, I would highly recommend this course to anybody who is interested in taking a history-based approach to economics."
Christopher Green ,4.0,4.0,N/A,"Professor Green's teaching style is not for everyone, but he understands that and makes it clear from the very first day. If you don't take it seriously to begin with it's your own fault. That being said, Professor Green is incredibly knowledgable and very passionate about the subject. Possible to get a lot out of class but it's up to you to try"
Christopher Green ,5.0,4.0,A-,"Prof Green is the kind of Economics Professor I wish I had had earlier in my McGill career. He's incredibly knowledgeable about the material he teaches, though occasionally the lectures can be fairly dry. Very open to questions and willing to discuss ideas in depth."
Christopher Green ,1.0,4.0,A-,Holy he just threatened us that if ask to get a paper remarked he will drop the marker... How is he allowed to work.
Christopher Green ,1.0,3.0,B-,... he literally just said there's no actually grading scheme for this midterm. What did I write and what did he grade -_-
Christopher Green ,4.0,4.0,N/A,"One of my favourite Econ professors at McGill. Sometimes borderline paternalist in his Chinese Econ lectures, but have taken multiple other lectures with him and the extent of his knowledge is invaluable. One of the only econ profs who will ground the material in real life and offer a bigger picture. Willing to help and a funny guy."
Christopher Green ,3.5,4.0,A,He's seriously one of the best econ profs at McGill. SUPER dedicated to his craft of teaching & the material - his ppts are detailed & he constantly updates himself on the info. He always makes time for students... He might not be the most friendly but he's really respectful & humble. His course isn't an easy A but it's priceless. 
Christopher Green ,3.0,3.0,B,"Goes off tangent with background info on whatever topic he is lecturing during class so it can be hard to follow sometimes. The PowerPoints are very clear and detailed so despite not doing all the massive assigned readings, you can still do very well for the final if you studied the PowerPoints well. Grading was 50% Term Paper50% Final. "
Christopher Green ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"This guy is the nicest, most dedicated professor I've ever met at McGill. He's patient, attentive to students, and truly loves teaching. The course requires some work and the grading isn't the easiest, but it's really all been worth it. I also recommend for students who want to go to law school."
Christopher Green ,4.0,2.0,N/A,"Prof. Green is really nice and very helpful if you go to see him. He's also extremely knowledgeable on the subject! Sometimes his lectures are a bit disorienting, but this class is pretty unique and definitely worth taking. If you do the readings its great."
Christopher Green ,5.0,1.0,N/A,Chris Green is literally the best person/professor I've ever had at McChill.
Christopher Green ,1.5,4.0,N/A,"Chris Green is an old and dogmatic professor, often very confused with his material and unable to speak a sentence without losing track of what he is saying.The class is interesting, be but careful, there is ALOT of material covered. Going to class is useless, just do the readings and read the slides. Overall interesting material but boring prof."
Christopher Green ,2.0,3.0,N/A,"Whatever everyone says, this class is NOT hard. Just read the course pack carefully and you don't even have to go to class all that much. The stuff is interesting, not gonna lie, competition policy and the feud between company mergers are way more interesting than economic calculations I've done in other classes."
Christopher Green ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"this man is a huge beauty and adorable- the subject matter of this class is dry but it's not his fault. he makes it more interesting and you can tell he loves it. he explains things really clearly and is clear about what to know for the exam, and you actually learn. would highly recommend taking this class"
Christopher Green ,2.5,3.0,N/A,"Only took Chinese economy with Prof. Green, but I think he is a model of how an Econ prof should teach undergrads.He is also one of the few profs in the department who, thankfully, takes a more holistic approach to economics not fanatically concerned with econometrics, and I say this a alum of the (calc-based) Honours Program. Fairly open-minded"
Christopher Green ,4.5,3.0,N/A,professor green is hands down one of the best in the econ department. he knows so much about the material and you can tell he really cares about it too. on top of that he is both likeable and personable. i recommend this class to anyone interested in economics because it offers insight into issues that many other mcgill econ classes dont.
Christopher Green ,4.5,4.0,N/A,Amazing professor! Easily the best prof I had at McGill. very stimulating class and he's really into it. He encourages you to participate in class and is open to any kind of alternatives to his explanations (as long as you have arguments). He's a tough grader but it's worth it
Christopher Green ,1.5,4.0,N/A,avoid this guy at all costs. very rude and arrogant. he's NOTHING compared to ragan/watson but how he treats students is as if hes  paul krugman and we're grade 8
Christopher Green ,1.5,4.0,N/A,"Definitely the worst professor at McGill. Insensitive, obnoxious, rude, full of himself. Incessant ramblings and digressions in class. Rude and unapproachable out of class. Avoid at all cost. I got a good grade but I hated this class and Green's personality."
Christopher Green ,2.5,1.0,N/A,"As professor for The Chinese Economy, Green was committed, passionate, and hard-working; regrettably, he was also dogmatic, tedious, and often confused by his own material. To his credit, the textbook he has selected (Naughton) is both excellent and cheap; just go read it and save yourself the headache."
David Ronis ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"I think Prof Ronis is amazing, but I know a lot of people from my class would give him negative comments, so I am here to justify. His lectures are amazing, definitely interesting and he was there to make sure you understand the stuff he taught. Well, having said that, I know people from life sci would complain about the level of difficulty."
David Ronis ,3.5,4.0,A+,Prof. Ronis is a God amongst men in the chemistry department. He is extremely intelligent but does not realise that those around him are not at his level. Most problem sets are extremely time consuming but are a must if you want to pass the course. 
David Ronis ,4.0,5.0,N/A,"Very smart guy who gives very tough exams. MEMORIZE his coursepack, redo his assignments and you'll do fine. Ronis is a very nice prof overall. And you can't avoid him if you're majoring in Chemistry!"
David Ronis ,4.5,4.0,N/A,"I thought Ronis did a good job of teaching the material. It would have been helpful if he did a few more examples during lectures, but if you don't understand something, you can drop into his office almost anytime and he will help you out. Exams are tough but fair if you attend lectures, study the course pack, and do the problem sets."
David Ronis ,3.5,3.0,N/A,"Prof. Ronis seems intimidating especially in the first few weeks of the course. Try to do the problem sets on your own, copying will screw you over in the end. If you ever have questions, his door is always open and he loves to help students. The course pack is your bible, USE IT. If you want a good grade you just have to put in the work."
David Ronis ,1.5,5.0,N/A,"SO CONFUSING. Lectures are hard to follow, and he rarely does examples which screws you over on the problem sets. Homework questions often have need completely new information that he never touches on in class. Grades after the midterm had ~16 F's, and 3A's."
David Ronis ,3.5,5.0,N/A,"Challenging course but Ronis is a good prof, probably one of the best prof I've had so far at McGill. The main challenge of the course lies in the fact that one has to learn all the derivations in his coursepack. You might find that tedious but doing that, you really learn physical chemistry and not just a bunch of formulas."
David Ronis ,2.5,5.0,N/A,"Very mathematically grounded course and brilliant teacher, and precisely why it was my favourite this semester. Notorious ""soul-searching"" course, but rewarding to those that remain committed."
David Ronis ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"Students in this department seem to complain just for the sake of complaining. He is very clear in his lectures. His exams are tough, but fair. The only drawback is that he does not follow very closely from the textbooks, so attending lectures is a must."
David Ronis ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"The WORST professor in McGill.. There's no other word to describe him but ""HORRIBLE!"" The course is ridiculously difficult. All you need to do is just memorize the entire course material.. He is also very arrogant. Good luck.."
David Ronis ,1.5,5.0,N/A,"Ridiculously hard evaluations (Midterm, Final). Does tend to take questions directly out of the assignments for the final, therefore, memorization of the answers is a must. Otherwise, a nice and funny prof, albeit a bit arrogant."
David Ronis ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"Brutal class!  I majored in Chemistry because I actually had fun doing org chem and was enjoying school.  After taking this class I am now doing a liberal in biochem and his course has left a bitter and sour taste in my mouth.  He is arrogant, belittling (unless you're as smart as him), boring, and completely unhelpful. Horribly hard course."
David Ronis ,2.0,5.0,N/A,"Ronis gets annoyingly frustrated when you don't understand what he's teaching, even if you go see him after class for help.  Midterm was practically improssible (56 average) and he refuses to scale.  Ronis and CHEM 223 made me transfer into Anatomy & Cell Biology - no joke.  This course is NOT easy."
David Ronis ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"Great guy, very smart.  If you are excited going into this class, good for you, I'm sure you will love it.  If you are in any way unsure of whether you will enjoy this class or not, this class is going to be the most painful experience of your life.  You will leave class everyday with a queasy feeling in your stomach, knowing you will fail"
David Ronis ,1.0,5.0,N/A,Worst. Does not know how to teach. Talks to himself through the whole class. He's a nice guy but the guy can't teach at all. All he does during class is write the derivatives and expect us to know everything he says and writes. Notes do not help at all. HARD cours
David Ronis ,4.5,4.0,N/A,Really great teacher. Hard stuff but he teaches it well.
David Ronis ,4.5,3.0,N/A,Excellent teacher. One of few professors in Chem. Depart. who is mathematically clear. Ideal for students with physics/math background. Presumed to be hell for non-math chem students.
David Ronis ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"Professor Ronis is an excellent professor.  He presents difficult material in a clear and methodical manner.  The course material is hard and he doesn't dumb it down.  The problem sets take a long time, and derivations must be studied.  But his tests are fair, he will spend hours outside class helping students, and he's an excellent lecturer."
David Ronis ,2.5,5.0,N/A,"He (and most of the textbooks I've looked at to help me) skips a lot of ""minor"" details, so it always feels like there's a missing step (or 5). There's also a big gap between the material we are taught and the actual problems we are expected to do. He's nice and coherent, but he never actually does sample problems during class, just derivations..."
David Ronis ,2.0,5.0,N/A,Memorize his ntoes and ur fine. Extremely hard class... He thinks he knows everything and hes not that funny
Louis Chauvin ,5.0,3.0,N/A,Reoriented my life. This was more than a class! Thank you professor!
Louis Chauvin ,4.0,2.0,B+,"Truly, Louis was a great professor. He's passionate, and that makes him vocal. Some hate him for it; some truly respect him for it. I'm the latter. He makes you think and feel -- what else can you ask of a course? Take him for a new experience that you wont forget; avoid him if you want the same old, same old. ATTEND THE CLASS TO GET AN A. "
Louis Chauvin ,1.5,3.0,B-,"Very biased, not even willing to consider other points of view. Assignment throughout the semester is very time consuming and grading criteria is not clear- incredibly subjective. Did not enjoy the lectures, though the guest speakers were very interesting. "
Louis Chauvin ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"Chauvin is the best. To do well in this class, you need to know how to self-reflect and really be introspective about how you perceive the world. If you can't do that, you're gonna have a bad time. Personally I loved the class and found it really easy. He's an amazing guy, great prof."
Louis Chauvin ,1.5,4.0,N/A,"Would not recommend this professor.  Although the course material is interesting, he solely focuses it on environmental issues - simply showing videos and preaching his views. He is knowledgeable about the issues he raises, but leaves little room for you to develop and share your own (sometimes differing) opinions."
Louis Chauvin ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"Very good prof. The course material is not the most interesting nor is it intellectually demanding. However, his method is refreshingly original. Just the type of class that these uptight rich kids at McGill need."
Louis Chauvin ,3.5,3.0,N/A,"Nice person, Cares about the class... be prepared to drink the coolaid if you want a good grade."
Louis Chauvin ,4.0,2.0,N/A,Chauvin is a really great prof! By far the most down to earth prof I've met. Not afraid to say things that you wouldn't typically hear in a management class. He gives a different perspective. His class is not for everyone but I really enjoyed it.
Louis Chauvin ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"I still disagree with almost everything he said, but I have respect for him. By far the most interesting prof in management. I leanred more from him than any other prof at McGill. Also no final or midterm, and nothing to learn, you're only tested on the depth of your thought. I highly reccomend him."
Louis Chauvin ,4.0,2.0,N/A,"Meditation, awkward one-on-one chats with other students to start every class, hippie rhetoric...needless to say, this class isn't for everyone. But Chauvin is a wonderful person and is truly passionate about this stuff. I just felt like I merely paid lip service to idealistic liberal babble for a semester. Cute, but as a class, it gets old quick."
Louis Chauvin ,5.0,3.0,N/A,By far best prof at McGill - it was an honour being Prof. Chauvin's student. Good to see teacher's like him still exist!
Louis Chauvin ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"Amazing guy. Easily the best prof I've had at McGill. Changed my viewpoint on life (for the better). Ignore all bad comments about him, those people don't know what they're talking about. He should be head of the department!"
Louis Chauvin ,4.5,5.0,N/A,"Amazing prof, for an amazing class (Business in Society). Seriously, I don't think anyone else could teach that class and bring it so such a level of introspection. This class is mostly about self-questioning, and learning about who you are, where society is taking us, etc. and he's really respectful of everyone's point of view. No midterm no final"
Louis Chauvin ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"Amazing prof. No one at McGill will get you thinking as much as him, but not in a bad way. He breaks from the status quo of education. Will get you reflecting lots. If you don't like class with attendance don't take him, but if you don't mind the absolutely the best prof."
Louis Chauvin ,4.5,2.0,N/A,AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING
Louis Chauvin ,4.0,2.0,N/A,"Very, very interesting professor. While attending the class throughout the term there were times when I loved him and times when I hated him. That being said, his classes are very thought provoking and interesting. He is definitely not for everybody but I'd generally reccomend him for the experience."
Louis Chauvin ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"what a guy, genius. not for students afraid to express their opinions. life changing and inspirational if you are ready for it."
Louis Chauvin ,4.5,2.0,N/A,I very good teacher. Unique to the management faculty. Adds much needed balance to a managament school based entirely on Finance and big industry. I fully recommend you to take any class he teaches (Social Context/Business in Society)
Louis Chauvin ,4.0,2.0,N/A,"If you're weak minded, you'll get caught up in his brainwash-propaganda and fast, if not you'll spend the sem arguing with most the class who are. The issues are relevant, his solutions are impractical; but you do come out different, better or worse. He's marks pretty rough; I've never got marks off for giving too much relevant info but here we are"
Louis Chauvin ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Maybe the most controversial prof in the faculty, but probably the wisest. This course will challenge almost everything you have learned in management and stimulate thoughtful examination of the way you live your life.  If you're willing to open your mind though, Chauvin may be the best prof you will ever have.  I highly recommend him."
Melanie Nash ,4.5,5.0,N/A,I graduated ten years ago. If I close my eyes to remember the most impactful academic moment at uni- It was Nash's class on the cinema of the 1970s that stands out. I am now working on some oscar contendersofthis year.  In Nash's class I saw for the first time that someone could make a career out of something the loved. Unintentionally inspiring!
Melanie Nash ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"She taught THE most interesting topics (i.e. Sex, Gender and Reproduction in Horror Film - come ON) and made lectures, papers, presentations and even exams a total pleasure. She let us present on 1970s**** in her 70s film class, and even gave our group a ton of recommendations for films to watch to support our thesis. Tough, but made you want to w"
Melanie Nash ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"She was the best prof I had at McGill. I loved all five of her courses, and she inspired me more than any other film theorist I have known. She's shy, but amazing and brilliant. Also..a total hottie."
Melanie Nash ,1.0,4.0,N/A,She's the worst prof at McGill by far.
Melanie Nash ,1.0,4.0,N/A,"As a straight chick, I can't comment on the hotness. I will say, however, that her lectures were stultifyingly boring, and she was the least available of any prof. I've ever had at McGill. If you're into rote learning, take her course, it ain't special."
Melanie Nash ,1.0,5.0,N/A,I never enjoyed her course.  She was arrogant and very unapproachable.  She needs to learn a lot about communicating with students and treating them like humans.
Melanie Nash ,3.5,4.0,N/A,Hot professor...but very moody!
Melanie Nash ,5.0,3.0,N/A,sexy in a cute kind of way.
Melanie Nash ,3.0,4.0,N/A,teaches like a sexy cartoon super-villain.
Melanie Nash ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"Best professor I've had at McGill. Clear, entertaining lectures and her tests can actually be a pleasure to write. She will let you do ANYTHING for presentations and papers and help you when you get stuck."
Melanie Nash ,3.5,4.0,N/A,"for theory she's excellent... very clear, makes readings make sense... really really smart, does simpsons impressions... she's hard and strict but you LEARN and she made theory interesting"

Trevor Ponech ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"Great prof - there for you, especially if you put in the effort!"
Trevor Ponech ,3.0,5.0,N/A,"I've never had a prof give so much feedback on papers. He reads through drafts and responds relatively quickly to e-mails. That being said, I found him to be a hard marker. Although participation is worth a lot, he does not give much time in class to actually participate. If you have strong writing skills and like cinema, this class is for you. "
Trevor Ponech ,1.5,5.0,N/A,"Horrible prof. Uncaring. Cold. His lectures are incoherent, and it's clear he doesn't really like students at all."
Trevor Ponech ,3.5,4.0,N/A,"Despite the difficulty of this course, I must say that it was one of the most enjoyable that I have ever taken. Prof. Ponech really puts a lot of effort in coming up with interesting class discussions. This was one of those classes that stimulate one's mind. Moreover, he is very committed to his students and a truly nice and funny gentleman."
Trevor Ponech ,2.0,4.0,N/A,Don't.
Trevor Ponech ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"Best courses of my life were with Dr. Ponech. I took 3 while at McGill and took another while in a graduate program at another university. He is extremely bright, which makes writing papers very difficult because anything that isn't logically sound is pounced upon. Not for the faint of heart, his courses will make you think hard and long."
Trevor Ponech ,2.0,3.0,N/A,"Difficult readings.the material for the paper, the book the paper was on was examined after the paper was due."
Trevor Ponech ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"If you are going to take his class make sure you do your readings for each lecture or else you WILL be lost. The exam content is unexpected, he ask at least ONE specific question. No idea how I can guide future students to study since he doesn't prepare students for the exam:S all I can say is. good luck..."
Trevor Ponech ,1.0,5.0,N/A,DON'T DO IT!
Trevor Ponech ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"JUst stAY IN CLASS IF YOU ARE HANDING IN YOUR PAPERS OR $H1t WILL HIT THE FAN NO JOKE HE JUST DID THIS THIS MORNING DANGER!!!  But in all seriousness, Be careful he will fail you if you hand in a paper and dont stay for no reason.  Have a nice life!!!"
Trevor Ponech ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"I have never been so inclined to post on this site until I listened to Trevor Ponech. He has ruined the english language for me, as well as my GPA. Pompous and unnecessarily verbose, he is the worst."
Trevor Ponech ,1.5,3.0,N/A,"likely the most unprofessional and inept professor I have yet seen when it comes to actual teaching - to give an indication rather than give a set of criteria by which he evaluates your assignment he does the assignment himself and gives you this: I gave his essay to 4 other profs in the subject to see what they would grade it, the highest was a B"
Trevor Ponech ,1.5,4.0,N/A,"Hands down the worst professor I've had at McGill. What began as annoying quirks to his lectures, made its way up to him frequently insulting the class and our lack of ""taste""-- he is a pompous, angry man and there is absolutely on reason to put up with him unless it's a required course."
Trevor Ponech ,1.0,2.0,N/A,"This is probably the most boring class I have ever taken in my life.  I wasn't a fan of the prof.  To his credit, he seems to be really into the material. The good thing is I went to about 10% of the lectures and only read the stuff I had to write the papers on, and still got a B-.  Not bad, but learned nothing."
Trevor Ponech ,4.0,4.0,N/A,"First-rate, fun on documentaries esp."
Trevor Ponech ,1.5,1.0,N/A,No Comments
Trevor Ponech ,1.5,4.0,N/A,"From the first few lectures, I didn't think this guy was gonna be SO bad, just a little dry and boring. But by the end, I literally couldn't take the class anymore. His marking was unfair and subjective and his poetics of the image class completely disregarded the CULTURAL element, turning it into a theory course. the worst, trust the reviews."
Trevor Ponech ,3.0,5.0,N/A,"Let me say this: my film class was in the big Leacock room, with capacity for 627 students, and an average of 30 came to each class. PONECH = PRETENTIOUS & POMPOUS"
Trevor Ponech ,2.0,4.0,N/A,"Boring.He repeats the same thing over and over again.  Even if it is an English class, you should be able to do well in a 200 if you have done CEGEP english.  He marked the essays very severly.  I would NOT take this class, he rarely talks about the films and I heard only complaints."
Trevor Ponech ,1.5,2.0,N/A,"Very, very boring.  Class is extremely tedious and hard to sit through, most people only go to the screenings.  This is compunded by the fact that most of the readings are unnescessary.  THe course is easy enough if you can write well, but you will fail if you can't"
Donald Taylor ,3.5,3.0,N/A,Great prof. but his lectures are a bit boring in my opinion but the material is clear. Midterm was really difficult but the final was quite easy. You have to read the books if you want a good grade! Graders are really though for the paper.
Donald Taylor ,3.5,3.0,N/A,"He's a very engaging and funny lecturer, though a bit confusing at times as he can move from one idea to another quickly and it can be hard to understand his point. The material is super interesting, the 2 textbooks are well written and easy to study, though his exams are somewhat harder than the average psyc exam. Really enjoyed the course overall"
Donald Taylor ,3.5,3.0,B+,"Psyc 331 was a great class. Prof. Taylor is an all-around good guy. He may ramble on sometimes during lectures about his experiences but it's all in good fun. Read the books, do the work, and you'll enjoy the class. It's very enjoyable. Study HARD. Exam questions can sometimes be strange but if you do the readings and study well, you'll be fine."
Donald Taylor ,3.5,3.0,N/A,Don's class was great! I loved the content. I you enjoyed Social Psychology you will enjoy this class as well! He is a Great teacher with so much experience... His books are a good read and not too long. The tests are not easy but doable. I recommend this class. 
Donald Taylor ,4.5,3.0,A-,"I don't understand why people rate him badly, I'm an B student and finished with a A- and didn't put much work into it. The teacher is amazing, funny, and clear. He is repeatable but for a reason: it'll all be in the exams. Exams are detailed oriented, and pay attention to his anecdotes, but text is so small and it's easier than  most psych classes"
Donald Taylor ,3.5,5.0,N/A,"Professor Taylor is quite a showman.  Expect it and enjoy the ride.  You will have a good time on top of learning a lot ! You can expect a bit of repetition but its ok.  As for the evaluation process. Sadly consistent with the faculty of Psychology, it is meant to meet a bell curve.  Get help from previous students to know how to prepare  succeed"
Donald Taylor ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"One of the better Profs I've had in Psychology, and there are a lot of good ones. Really interesting and engaging lectures, and the content is easy to digest if you pay attention. You won't ever be tempted to skip class. His exams, well, Psych exams are always hard. Go see him in his office, even if just to chat, he likes to meet his students."
Donald Taylor ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"very entertaining and funny lecturer loved him!  the material (first half) is so interesting, after the midterm it gets dull and repetitive. the midterm was fairdetailednot much different than any psych exam. the paper is annoying but doable (hasn't been graded yet so i can't say much) readings are less than other psych courses."
Donald Taylor ,4.5,4.0,N/A,"PROS: Fantastic lectures. Very interesting material. Very engaging. Funny. CONS: Exams very tough, require enormous attention to detail.   Know each theory inside & out, pay attention to his tangents (there are many). Also, let him finish a thought before you get offended as he often gives voice to all sides of a debate so as to set up a point. "
Donald Taylor ,2.0,4.0,N/A,The only B I have received in the last two years of my undergrad. The gradings on the paper (worth more than the midterm) are a complete hit or miss (you either get an nice grad student grader or you don't). His material is interesting but there is ZERO structure to the course and most of the time it is story time. NOT worth lowering your GPA for.
Donald Taylor ,5.0,1.0,N/A,This class is a must. You'll never want to miss a class! Text is exactly what's taught in lectures and is SO small. I ended up loving the material and learnt a lot. Paper could not have been more straightforward. Easy A if you put in the work (and there isn't much of it). LOVE U DON!!
Donald Taylor ,4.0,1.0,N/A,"Don't know why he gets such a bad rep. Exams were fine. Paper was beyond straight forward. Should be especially easy for psych students. Plus, he's a good story teller. This is one of the birdies of the Psychology program, but really worth taking since its not as dry as some others."
Donald Taylor ,3.5,4.0,N/A,Amazing prof. Loved the class.
Donald Taylor ,4.0,3.0,N/A,I took this class years ago yet still remember points he made clear as day. A very enjoyable class which makes you just want to sit back and listen - but do take notes too.
Donald Taylor ,4.0,1.0,N/A,Only teaches his own research. Story-telling style of teaching with a lot of humour. You go to class not because it's necessary (it really really isn't) but because he's so engaging. Not about marks (don't even break a sweat) but critical exposure to a group of undervalued Canadians.
Donald Taylor ,3.0,3.0,N/A,"I love Taylor! Really funny and expressive character (as most social psych profs are). His exams were a bit weird. Some were really straightforward and related to the lectures/book and some were not. It's really a crapshoot. Regardless, study as much as you can and you'll probably end up with a good mark."
Donald Taylor ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"AMAZING TEACHER! He simplifies tough concepts into very simple explanations. He's quite funny too; each class can easily lighten up your day by giving you a nice laugh, as well as learning some useful and interesting stuffs! However, his exams are definitely hard; study the lectures VERY well, because he will likely ask very minitious questions..."
Donald Taylor ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"The guy was really great, approachable and down to earth. He is funny and tells in depth examples to make the theory's relate to life. Class is really easy as long as you go to class and take notes on the stories he tells, they may seem like little antidotes but his tests include them (I think its to make sure people are going to class)."
Donald Taylor ,4.0,2.0,N/A,"He is awesome, but make sure to take notes on ALL of the random stuff he talks about in his lectures, no matter how irrelevent it seems. He tests on everything. But he is still one of my favorite professors at McGill. Classes are so much fun!"
Donald Taylor ,4.0,2.0,N/A,"Taylor is definitely my favorite prof at McGill so far. He's very interesting to listen to, I always lookedfrward to his class! If you take careful notes on the textbook and study the details of his lecture its definitely possible to get an A. A midterm and a straight-forward paper. Highly recommend it!"
David Ostry ,5.0,3.0,A,His class is very interesting. He is very knowledgable and passionate about what he teaches.
David Ostry ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Such a great professor. He is passionate about what he does which is the most important thing. He made a subject I didn't find particularly interesting in neuroscience (sensorimotor system) really interesting, and he's so cute! Very knowledgable, and sweet."
David Ostry ,2.5,2.0,N/A,He has good slides and does a thorough job at going through them in lectures but does nothing more than that. However this course is fairly easy and if you do all the relevant problems in the textbook you're fine.
David Ostry ,4.0,1.0,B,Easiest class at McGill. Gives Art of Listening a run for its money! The final is much harder than the midterm but still really easy. Ostry often cancels class due to mysterious trips to the US of A. Seriously take this course.
David Ostry ,4.0,2.0,N/A,"Good teacher, he explains everything very well. Some questions are unclear in the Ferguson book tho, and you might have to read on your own for certain details. Other then that, he knows how boring his class is, and he's trying to make it fun. Repeats everything lots of times.The midterm = super easy, the final = long/weird questions but doable"
David Ostry ,1.5,5.0,N/A,"confusing questions, unclear expectations and unavailable. awful professor stay away from any classes he teaches"
David Ostry ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"One of my favourite profs! He explains everything super well, and repeats important information over and over again. He is very helpful when asked questions, and really encourages questions during class. The exam questions are completely predictable, but the marking may be a little unfair at times."
David Ostry ,4.5,3.0,N/A,Such a funny guy. Really enjoy attending his lectures.
David Ostry ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"awful unclear professor, hard exams, unclear expectations"
David Ostry ,1.5,4.0,N/A,"horrible teacher! I have trouble staying awake in class, let alone pay attention and try to learn! Finals are beyond anything we've ever done before! Avoid taking his class at all costs. You'll be so much happier without him!"
David Ostry ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"Seems like a great guy, teaches a very easy class. Not much material, can learn everything in a day or two. Exams were very simple, basically just use the formulas he gives you."
David Ostry ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"Really funny guy. Clear, simple powerpoint slides. Do all the questions assigned in the ferguson book and you'll be fine."
David Ostry ,5.0,2.0,N/A,He's a great prof. Explains everything well and cares about his students. Straightforward class.
David Ostry ,3.0,1.0,N/A,"this course has such bare content that it could be compressed easily into half a semester. the prof has a likable personality. hes not a bad teacher but doesnt go above and beyond either. do the questions in the book but expect a little tougher on the exam, and you should be ok."
David Ostry ,4.0,1.0,N/A,I don't know what people are complaining about. The material was pretty straight forward and the final was nothing special; you just had to understand the equation instead of only memorizing it.
David Ostry ,2.0,3.0,N/A,The content is OK but the prof is helpless. never have homework or extra practice but the final is something beyond the handout
David Ostry ,2.0,4.0,N/A,"The course is not terribly difficult and his teaching is not that bad (lots of examples) but the final exam is a horror, there wasn't enough time and it was extremely hard. Also, the Ferguson text is incomprehensible and reads like something from the dark ages."
David Ostry ,1.0,4.0,N/A,"awful prof, awful examiner"
David Ostry ,2.0,5.0,N/A,"If you are a weak math student, do not take this course with Ostry. His lectures are boring and not interactive. He does not provide assignments to keep you on track throughout the semester, and the text is hard to understand without supplemental material. As many people before have said, take it with Amsel."
David Ostry ,1.5,3.0,N/A,"one of the worst profs i ever met he is soo boring staying awake in his lecture is impossible ,the starting material is not bad then it gets hard his midterm was really easy but the FINAL WAS SOOOO HARD  i have no idea where he got it from .AVOID AT ALL COSTS"
Kenneth MacKenzie ,1.0,5.0,N/A,Very nice prof but shouldn't be teaching anymore. You think you understand but during the exam it feels like you don't know anything. Would recommend taking another prof for ECON 227 since it's mandatory for Econ majors. Go to his office hours and work A LOT on your own if you want a good grade.
Kenneth MacKenzie ,5.0,3.0,A+,"KMack is an essential part of the 'McGill Experience'. He is a great lecturer, super straightforward, and gives questions that are similar to what comes on the midterm and final. I like to call him the gentle giant. Attendance was low for the class, which is why I think the average is bad. BEWARE, extremely unorganized, he messed up all my grades."
Kenneth MacKenzie ,2.0,5.0,N/A,"Good man, very nice, but shouldn't be teaching anymore. First quiz was very easy, midterm was very hard due to poorly worded questions. Second quiz should have been easy but like his previous exams there were mistakes riddled throughout. Average for the class rn is maybe around a 50 (you can see everyones grade).S/U-covid is saving my GPA luckily."
Kenneth MacKenzie ,2.0,5.0,N/A,"He's the sweetest prof ever but i never knew it'd be possible to be this disorganized. Don't be surprised if he does lose or misplace students' marks and documents frequently. Took his class because people say that its an easy A if you put in the work and do his practices problems. However, over half of my class is failing his course."
Kenneth MacKenzie ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"I absolutely adore Kmack. Hes the sweetest prof out there. Yes hes extremely forgetful and unorganized but you gotta give him a break... Hes been teaching the class maybe even before our parents were born. Straight forward quizzes, difficult final. Go to his Office Hour, hes the best. I can never hate him even if I get an F for the class"
Kenneth MacKenzie ,1.0,2.0,A+,"Disorganized, cannot hear a thing in his lectures, grading takes more than a month. His midterms are quite easy but the finals stab your back. He goes off tangent soooooo much it's kind of hard at times to understand if he's lecturing or not."
Kenneth MacKenzie ,5.0,1.0,F,"He's such an energetic lecturer- usually I don't pay much attention in class but Professor Ken can get anyone passionate about economics! In fact, it is because of him that I transfered out of management into economics. It also helps that he is v attractive (went to A LOT of office hours)"
Kenneth MacKenzie ,5.0,1.0,A,"Such an easy class and such a cool prof! His assessments are very easy and his lectures are a lot of fun. Only downside is he has no clue how to use mycourses. If you miss a lecture there are no slides or anything to learn from, that content is lost to you forever."
Kenneth MacKenzie ,5.0,2.0,A,The nicest prof youll ever have at McGill. He doesnt try to trick you and exams are very easy. Dont need much studying to ace the class.
Kenneth MacKenzie ,4.0,2.0,A,"ECON 227 was a train wreck on the administration side (lost exams, grades never coming back, etc.), but KMack cares a lot about his students. If you go to class and put in enough practice before his exams, you're very likely to get an A (plus you get to hear his awesome bagpipe playing at the end of each semester :D )."
Kenneth MacKenzie ,5.0,2.0,A,"Although an absolute disaster administratively, Prof Mackenzie is one of the best lecturers I have had at McGill and also one of the most sweetest and generous. The exams were very easy if you went to class and took notes. He also provided and went through past papers that were nearly identical to the exams we had. An absolute gem!"
Kenneth MacKenzie ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"Professor MacKenzie is a gem- the nicest prof you'll find at McGill. Always makes time for students to see him after class/during office hours. Exams are straightforward with no surprises. An A is v achievable if you keep up. Sometimes he needs organizational assistance, but keep in mind he has to handle 3 sections of the same intro course."
Kenneth MacKenzie ,2.0,2.0,N/A,"A nice prof who obviously cares, but extremely disorganized. Never prints enough copies of midterms, and once made 30 students leave and come take the exam a week later because of this. Changes his office hours without warning and regularly skips or reteaches material because he forgets what we've done. Easy class but stressful and frustrating."
Kenneth MacKenzie ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"Professor KmacK is very entertaining and clearly works because he loves his discipline; he isn't in it for the money or the job conditions. That being said, beware of his confused ways to teach and evaluate his class."
Kenneth MacKenzie ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"Sweetest prof out there! He makes stats really accessible to students who have no math/stats background and always provides example questions and past quizzes/exams so you know what to expect when you're tested. He's ALWAYS available for questions, and even had office hours on weekends because he genuinely wants his students to succeed."
Kenneth MacKenzie ,1.0,5.0,B,"Extremely disorganized professor: lost 100 quizzes (grades never returned), never has enough handouts/quizzes to give students when he needs to, forgets his calculator or other things and makes us waste time. This professor seems completely clueless and it isn't fair to have such professors at University."
Kenneth MacKenzie ,5.0,1.0,A,"If you take down good notes during lectures and do his practice quizzes, midterms and finals multiple times until you understand every type of problem, there is no reason that you shouldn't get an A. No surprises on exams."
Kenneth MacKenzie ,3.0,3.0,N/A,"KMac's lectures are boring as he takes very long to explain each process and he usually does a lot of errors in his calculations. However, he clearly knows a lot about statistics and that's nice. Don't expect your midterm grades to be returned. We're already entering second semester and I still don't have my grade..."
Kenneth MacKenzie ,1.0,4.0,N/A,"It's clear that KMack is very knowledgable about ECON, but his ability to transfer that knowledge to students is nonexistant. Syllabus is outdated, and tbh useless bc he doesnt follow it. No one understood how much each exam was worth. No explanation was ever given. No grades were distributed. Went into the final not knowing where I stood."
Kenneth MacKenzie ,5.0,3.0,A-,"Extremely knowledgable, amazing at lecturing, is very patient/kind and helpful during office hours, and clearly just wants you to succeed (unlike many ECON profs). BUT, administratively, he needs assistance. Loses assignments, forgets to assign assignments --- the syllabus will not be followed. Be comfortable not knowing where you stand pre-final."
Donald Baronowski ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"He is so sweet, helpful and dedicated and works so hard! If you're doing Latin, I can't recommend him enough - and remember to go to class because although the subject can be hard, he is super helpful and way clearer than any textbook. :)"
Donald Baronowski ,5.0,1.0,N/A,By far the best professor at McGill. Truly enjoys helping out students and his marks are not burdensome (very generous). Never has intelligence been accompanied by his awe-inspiring humility.
Donald Baronowski ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"By far the nicest professor at McGill. Not only does he know so much, but he is so humble. Latin is a hard subject but the teacher is so helpful that all the obstacles are made less burdensome. He is also funny and anyone who laughs at Martial's poems is in my opinion a good man."
Donald Baronowski ,5.0,3.0,N/A,He is so cute! Genuinely cares for his students and very helpful. Class did get a bit dull sometimes though
Donald Baronowski ,5.0,1.0,N/A,An excellent professor teaching a very interesting and worthwhile course.  He is very kind and approachable and makes time to answer everybody's questions.  His in-class explanations are precise and clear.  Tests and assignments are not at all difficult.  I highly recommend this prof. and this course!
Donald Baronowski ,2.0,3.0,N/A,"Dr. Barinowski is a great cute little guy. He is extremely likable and is always willing to help outside of class. However, inside class is a different story and the fact is that Latin is the worst subject I've ever had. Gret prof- don't ever take Latin"
Donald Baronowski ,3.5,3.0,N/A,"okay, yes he is a doll, he is very nice and very helpful. However Latin is just plain old difficult no matter how you cut it and involves a lot of work. It's not one of those easy A/B+ intro language classes, so before you just take latin blindly, make sure you look into it and know what it inlvolves...prof is very nice though and SOOOO friendly"
Donald Baronowski ,5.0,3.0,N/A,He's a doll!!  He's an incredible professor- very understanding and helpful.
Donald Baronowski ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"i took greek history and was so impressed i took this roman lit course blind. i wasn't much interested in it, but i figured he was so good before i couldn't go wrong. yet another great class thanks to this outstanding prof. he focuses on what is most important, which is rare these days. fair exams."
Donald Baronowski ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"Great Intro course, repeats himself like crazy so you are sure not to miss anything.  Is helpful and his exams are very fair.  Fantastic course to take as a first year student."
Donald Baronowski ,5.0,3.0,C,"Best teacher..so nice, helpful, interesting...and cute awwww"
Donald Baronowski ,5.0,3.0,C,Greatest teacher! He is very interesting and helpful.Looks like he enjoys what he does and therefore makes the course very enjoyable! Take him if you can.
Donald Baronowski ,4.5,2.0,C,"Awesome prof. OK, so he repeats himself, which at first was annoying. But soon, it became a huge plus for me. I never missed anything he said. He sticks to what is really important, and if you pay attention, you will walk out of this class with a very good understanding of basic greek history."
Donald Baronowski ,3.0,2.0,C,"boring teacher, yes yes, he's ""cute"" and enthusiastic and all that but geej, he repeats himself more than a hungy parrot. if you already know the material, don't take his classes, he'll bore you to death."
Donald Baronowski ,5.0,2.0,C,he's too cute and sweet; the man really loves what he does and makes the topic that much more interesting!
Donald Baronowski ,5.0,5.0,C,"Spoon fed course - best description. Such an interesting period of history, treated far too simplistically. However if you're just looking for an easy history course, this is is. In conclusion, boo."
Donald Baronowski ,3.5,4.0,B,"Roman History is interesting, but this professor could do a lot more to bring it to life. For those willing to devote a lot of time and effort to what might be an elective, this class might be an option. However, the class average is lower than most."
Donald Baronowski ,4.0,3.0,B,"I love Ancient Roman History and it was inspiring to see someone so enthusiastic about teaching it. And he's so cute and little!! LOL However, watch out for the TA's the one I had was really harsh - not the person you want grading your exam!But good class"
Donald Baronowski ,4.5,2.0,B,"knows his stuff, conveys the material clearly, overall a pretty good prof."
Donald Baronowski ,4.0,3.0,B,great prof. interesting and knows his stuff. expect to be writing madly the whole class. he doesn't stop.
Jen Wienstein ,4.5,1.0,N/A,She's amazing - beyond the best teacher i've had at mcgill and i really doubt they get better than this... Take her for intro to ital she's great.
Jen Wienstein ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"By far the nicest, fairest teacher I've ever had"
Jen Wienstein ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"Jen is absolutely adorable and a really great teacher. She is so sweet, laid-back, always very pleasant, and really truly cares about her students' success. Definitely recommend her! :)"
Jen Wienstein ,4.0,2.0,N/A,No Comments
Jen Wienstein ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"She is the best teacher I have ever had at McGill. The sweetest most thoughtful woman I have ever met. She truly cares about her students doing well in her class. You can knock on her door anytime, she will always be happy to help with any problem. I can't even get over how incredible she is. Great teacher and kind hearted."
Jen Wienstein ,3.5,3.0,N/A,"She's ok... sometimes I think she's great, sometimes I don't. The course itself is heavy on grammar and has very little instruction in conversation and vocabulary, but that's basically true of all languages @ McGill."
Jen Wienstein ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"She's the best. Patient, helpful, cute, funny. She's got all the goods."
Jen Wienstein ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"Jen is fantastic.  She's one of the only profs at McGill that seems to truly care about her students, and wants us to do well."
Jen Wienstein ,4.5,4.0,N/A,Anyone who bashes her doesn'
Jen Wienstein ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"She is very kind and wants us to learn, she's great!"
Jen Wienstein ,4.0,2.0,N/A,"Extremely nice,but this course is very SLOW"
Bryan Sanctuary ,3.0,2.0,N/A,"Not a straight forward prof/course that requires you to think outside the box.. don't try to understand/memorize every derivative. Use the book, do practice problems and remember the things he repeats over and over in lectures - these will be on the exam! Prof is pretty helpful is you go to his office"
Bryan Sanctuary ,2.0,4.0,N/A,"Okay as a prof he isn't the best but he's far from the worst. For chem 203 attend the lectures because the videos will literally make you sleep. The book is your main source of info-read it, make notes from it, and do the problems+attend tutorials. You'll deffo get an A or at least an A-. Grading scheme is also lenient to give you the best grade."
Bryan Sanctuary ,2.0,4.0,N/A,"Very difficult to follow. Talks fast and scribbles fast and illegibly on projected paper page. We did very few problems together, and he blames the students for not working enough on their own (which may very well be true), but this does not excuse him from being a good instructor. His mandatory, overpriced e-textbook was a life saver."
Bryan Sanctuary ,2.0,5.0,N/A,"The course material itself is difficult, and the prof himself is very unorganized. I understand the content of BIOL 200 better than this course. My tips: a) go to lectures-watching the videos will literally put you to sleep b) READ THE BOOK AND MAKE NOTES FROM THE BOOK+DO PRACTICE Q's-basically the book is the only thing in this course thats okay"
Bryan Sanctuary ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"AVOID. AVOID. AVOID. Do chem 204 if necessary. Just all over the place, basically. Lectures are SO unclear. Does NOT explain anything. Basically, learning from his lectures is insanely difficult. Watch lecture recordings, read the text (SO MUCH BETTER) and do practice problems. Maybe you'll survive, but I certainly didnt. #RIPmyGPA"
Bryan Sanctuary ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"He's just all over the place. Says something and writes something else. Very uncoordinated. Lectures are kind of all jumbled up. Doesn't explain the important parts of a topic, rather mulls on and on about one single little thing that isn't even the main concepts. Avoid is possible. If not, read the textbook and make your own notes from them."
Bryan Sanctuary ,1.0,3.0,N/A,"Avoid at all costs. This professor is a paria in the science community and he is kinda proud of it. He wants you to buy his expensive ebook, which dosen't work on more than one machine. Don't get screwed."
Bryan Sanctuary ,2.0,4.0,C+,"He was all over the place. Very unclear lectures, however they are recorded so no need to show up. The first midterm was ok, second was much easier. He drops the lowest of the two which is good. Be prepared to do practice problems over and over again and learn definitions by heart (he enjoys asking about them on the exams). Final was impossible."
Bryan Sanctuary ,4.0,1.0,N/A,I think he was a very fair prof. Just write down what he writes in class and review his summary notes and do the problems. That is pretty much all what you need to succeed. He tells you exactly what will be on the exams! 
Bryan Sanctuary ,2.5,3.0,A,"He is a random and sassy old british man who is adorable but an awful lecturer. He even brought his dog into class and I love him for that. Lectures are all over the place so the textbook readings, practice problems, and online lecture summaries are a must. He drops the worst midterm so don't fret if you do bad on the first one. Second is easier."
Bryan Sanctuary ,1.0,4.0,N/A,"Says that people do poorly on his tests because the material is hard, and doesn't even consider the fact that maybe he's just teaching it wrong. He focuses on main ideas so much, like work is heat, that by the end of class that's all you know. You have no idea how to approach problems because he spent the hour saying the same the same thing..."
Bryan Sanctuary ,2.0,3.0,N/A,"Despite being a very nice man, his class should be avoided at all cost. He has a nice grading system which may get you a semi-decent grade, however he simply stands at the front deriving formulas and moves on. No examples, no practice problems. The students are left more confused than before they take the class. Very nice person, horrible teacher."
Bryan Sanctuary ,3.5,2.0,N/A,"good prof, very nice and sometimes funny, peppers his otherwise confusing lectures with nice stories. best part is his grading: when i took the course he gave 3 options and take whichever was the highest (midterm1midterm2final) - 303040 or 04060 or 40060"
Bryan Sanctuary ,3.0,2.0,A,"Lectures often seem pointless, but he really tries to interest students. The ebook is a MUST, take notes from the text and his lecture summaries and do all the exercises without looking at the solutions until after you're done, and you're basically guaranteed an A. Usually happy to answer questions at his office, but his answers can be confusing."
Bryan Sanctuary ,2.0,3.0,N/A,exams are easy. but id much rather a class with hard exams with a prof that makes sense and is clear than one thats  easy but the prof makes no sense.
Bryan Sanctuary ,2.5,3.0,N/A,"super scatter minded... jumping from topic to topic, though he reviews at the beginning of every lecture, a lot of times the material fail to match up: either he made mistakes last lecture, or during his review. studying for final is hard because the material is everywhere. he's always willing to help, but taking good notes is impossible.  "
Bryan Sanctuary ,3.0,2.0,N/A,"His lectures are confusing sometimes which can be frustrating, but he is so kind and really cares about his students and wants everybody the get the best grades possible!! Does a lot of confusing derivations that you don't need to know. Just keep going to class and review his summaries, do the problems in the book and you'll be fine. "
Bryan Sanctuary ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"I'm in last year of my undergraduate, so far I had any professors. Professor Sanctuary was one of my best professors. I love him, he cares about his students and likes them to understand the material very well and do very well in their chemistry exams. "
Bryan Sanctuary ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"He can be quite confusing at times and makes a few mistakes in his notes but his summaries are amazing! His midterms are super straightforward, much easier than the questions in the book he assigns.. He told us that when he was learning about thermodynamics, he failed his own midterm, so I figure part of this easiness is due to empathy! Love Bryan!"
Bryan Sanctuary ,3.5,2.0,N/A,Although his lectures may be confusing at times. He's a really nice and funny prof and cares about his students and their success in the course. His exams are pretty fair as long as you go over the class material and do the problems in the book. Definitely recommend him
Robert Levine ,4.5,1.0,N/A,"Fantastic professor. As a psychology student with no high school experience or interest in biology, I loved this course. I am now much more interested in biology and may pursue other bio classes. Levine is very helpful and more than fair.He even asked us to write on our M/C midterm booklet if we thought a question was unfair-for removal.Great prof!"
Robert Levine ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"I had to take this course as a prerequisite and was not excited, but he made it way better for me. A fabulous lecturer and really helpful, responds to emails quickly and is eager to help. I would take another course with him for sure!"
Robert Levine ,4.0,2.0,N/A,"I'm really not a science person, but this probably was my favourite course this semester. Though he sometimes goes on to tell stories that are not that relevant, the lectures are overall interesting and engaging. He's also funny, which made everything better especially when the class is at 8:30 a.m."
Robert Levine ,4.5,3.0,N/A,He is the best!! He really made me enjoy this class and I was sad when it was over.
Robert Levine ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"extremely witty, obviously brilliant. slides can get a bit lazy but he's still good at explaining things, you will do well if you listen to all the lectures."
Robert Levine ,3.0,2.0,N/A,"Funny during class and a fair grader, but not great in explaining concepts. A little scatter-brained."
Robert Levine ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"Great teacher, exam questions were fair. Makes classes funny by telling stories related to the stuff we've seen. Great motivator"
Robert Levine ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Professor Levine is great, who knew somebody could make cell metabolism seem interesting! One of the funniest professors I've ever had, made me laugh for the entire class."
Robert Levine ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"Levine is a great prof, very clear, and the midterms and final are very fair. I didn't open my textbook ONCE (still has the plastic on it!) and I got a B+; he says himself that the book is just there to clarify what he says in lectures, which are recorded. Take notes, pay attention, study, and you'll do well. Easiest bio class at McGill!"
Robert Levine ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"Very easy to understand.  Made the topics very interesting.  Great sense of humor, whole class laughs the whole lecture.  Inspiring prof."
Robert Levine ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"He is clear, fair, and honest. He doesn't make tricky questions. If you study, you'll do well. His jokes are clean and cute!"
Robert Levine ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"Dr. Levine is an amazing professor. He is extremely clear and helpful and up to date on the material. The best part about Dr. Levine's course is that he does not go out to trick you, If you put in the time, you will get the mark you want. All lectures are recorded and posted, although Dr. Levine's sense of humor makes attending class worthwhile."
Robert Levine ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"Dr. Levine is amazing! You can tell that he is constantly updating what he knows about the field of biology.I would recommend taking the class for fun, i learned a great deal about the basics of biology. Also the last part on evolution is crazy interesting!"
Robert Levine ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"Good professor. Pretty funny and you can tell that he's passionate about the subject, even though the class itself is very broad. As for the exams, review the lectures!! If you take good notes, you'll do very well. No one shows up to class because you don't really need to, but I'd say it's worth it."
Robert Levine ,4.5,1.0,N/A,"A funny dude! Sit up front and be privy to his quirky sense of humor and self-deprecation. A nice intimate class to attend (because no one shows up). Makes cool references - you can tell he has good musical taste, etc. and is just an all-around awesome individual. Students are very fond of him."
Robert Levine ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"Great prof! Midterms seemed quite straight forward. He's extremely helpful. As long as you go to lectures, you should be fine. Everything he says in lectures is everything you need to know. Textbook is definitely NOT REQUIRED. I never enjoyed bio before but he's a good prof. I would definitely take another course with him."
Robert Levine ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"i started out the course listening to all the lectures online (they were recorded), but liked the prof so much i started coming to class! Just take good notes and review them, he gives great powerpoints to help you. he's awesome"
Robert Levine ,3.5,2.0,N/A,"Definitely more boring than Brown and always ran classes right til the end unlike Brown. However his exams questions were so much easier unlike Brown's convoluted nonsense. If you're taking this class, it's likely not by choice anyway. You'll be fine. Get the book/cd (any edition) and use the book's website."
Robert Levine ,3.5,2.0,N/A,"i really don't like biology, but i really didn't think prof. levine helped. i found it impossible to get through his classes, and ended up listening to them online. the exams were not easy- they had a lot of random, in depth, annoying questions. the curve helps a lot though."
Robert Levine ,4.0,3.0,N/A,HILARIOUS and very apt to explain any questions students have. He was pretty amazing.
Laurie Hendren ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"Seems uneasy at first but with time you'll know that it's opposite. Very helpful, charming. She knows the subject very well and makes everything easy to understand. One of the great professor in the university."
Laurie Hendren ,5.0,4.0,N/A,interesting and rewarding lectures and assignments. she may be strict on some things but she's good-hearted.
Laurie Hendren ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"Her sarcastic humour keeps you awake through some of the dry parts of the material. Definitely a ""unique"" personality and teaching style.. at first she may seem hard to approach, but really I think she likes to help anyone who's willing to make an effort to learn. You can easily tell that she loves her subject which adds a lot to her lectures."
Laurie Hendren ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"Lot of work, Extremely interesting, One of my best course."
Laurie Hendren ,3.5,5.0,N/A,the effort I put into assignments and the project weren't appreciated. but i learned a lot in that course ..
Laurie Hendren ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"One of the best teacher at mcgill. Very funny, very interesting and extremely brillant person."
Laurie Hendren ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"Great teacher and one of the best classes I took. A lot of work, but very interesting. Exams are easy if you work on your project."
Laurie Hendren ,4.0,4.0,N/A,No Comments

Teresa Tripenbach ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"A liar, a fake, and rude.  Avoid at all costs"
Teresa Tripenbach ,3.0,2.0,N/A,"exam questions are NOT as bad as people say they are.very little memorization and all understanding, which is a nice change. very helpful and goes through tons of practice questions with you so you are prepared for the final."
Teresa Tripenbach ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"She is a clear, conscise teacher.  Her questions are not just memorize and regurgitate; she takes the time to make questions that require you to understand the text.  IMHO, her section requires very little memorization, and lots of understanding.  Gives plenty of practice questions in her notes."
Teresa Tripenbach ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"Overall, she's a good prof. Pretty clear & organised.  But, word of caution: try not to talk during class or leave early - I could see her becoming bitter in future years.  She already told us we're spoiled w/ WebCT & that we're rude for leaving class early :S"
Teresa Tripenbach ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Wow. She's hot. And respiration is the coolest section of the course. No more incessant memory work, just understanding. Harsh voice, but she's really good."
Teresa Tripenbach ,3.0,3.0,N/A,"She's not that bad, really.I don't know about her exam questions but she's pretty nice when you approach her to ask her a question and she will explain things pretty well.I think people don't like her because she teaches the hardest topic in the class, respiration..."
Teresa Tripenbach ,1.0,3.0,N/A,"somehow she's even worse than i expected...and i expected a pretty terrible prof. 
 makes students regret asking questions, snaps in class, doesn't define variables, and has a generally unpleasant countenance. good luck PHGY/ANAT/BIOC students out there"

Teresa Tripenbach ,1.5,4.0,N/A,She makes an uninteresting topic INCREDIBLY boring.
Teresa Tripenbach ,1.0,4.0,N/A,Horrible teacher... she thinks she's a God and you have to call her doctor or she'll snap at you... forget the 'Miss' calls in class! You'll develop an apetite for broccoli as she pronounces bronchioles the same way...
Teresa Tripenbach ,1.5,4.0,N/A,She makes learning respiration a misery. She is very degrading when you ask her questions. Her test questions are ambiguous and she is awful at explaining things. I've heard she is nice though?? - Good Luck

Teresa Tripenbach ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"One on one, she is one of the best that the department has to offer and is someone that naturally takes great interest in what is best for students. Often 210 gives people that wrong impression about her. What do you expect in a class of 600?"
Teresa Tripenbach ,1.0,4.0,N/A,Gives me the impression that she wants us to fail.  I dislike the lecturing she gave us when last year's midterm got distributed.  She's not clear and seems confused by her own material
Dino Zorbas ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"1985 Electric Power, electronic Instrumentation. Both valuable courses. Compared to other courses these by nature in electricity were straight forward. Class notes and lectures with documentation covered everything. Of course it was required to do exercises to learn and succeed these courses."
Dino Zorbas ,1.0,4.0,B+,"Absolutely useless. He's really nice when you go to his office hours but that's it. Good person, useless prof. Do not take this course with him. You'll regret it."
Dino Zorbas ,1.0,3.0,N/A,Useless course. Class is useless and the notes are useless. Avoid at all cost.
Dino Zorbas ,3.0,1.0,B+,I did not attend ANY of the lectures and tutorials. Ended up with a B+. I did however put effort into studying and understanding the material. I did not think I earned a legit B+ in my midterm and final exam. He probably boosted me to a B+ because he saw that I atleast tried and studied the subject. Good guy professor.
Dino Zorbas ,2.5,2.0,N/A,"Nice guy. But is very unclear in class. I basically learned everything by myself with the help of course pack, textbook and a friend from EE. The material is fairly easy."
Dino Zorbas ,2.5,3.0,N/A,"Unclear in class.  If the material were taught concisely, it could be finished in half a semester.  Not enough examples are done in class, and there are no solutions available to practice problems or past finals.  Final exam was much more difficult than homework problems, but was curved or something... Nobody failed in the end..."
Dino Zorbas ,2.5,3.0,N/A,"not the best class.not the clearist teacher. but you can't change that, he's the only one who teaches this class.dont worry if you dont understand at first, every is clear during the last week of class (review classes)"

Dino Zorbas ,1.0,4.0,N/A,"Worst prof ever. He's a nice guy, but his class consists of loosely grouped factoids from his life at Hydro-Quebec. Hard to understand unless you pull the answers from him. Avoid at all costs, but then again he's the only one teaching AEI so you're doomed no matter what, or take it at Concordia."
Dino Zorbas ,1.0,1.0,N/A,He has the distinction of being the most useless prof in Mech Eng. But the course can be very easy: pick up a book on basic EE and learn by yourself. I got an 'A' this way while sleeping through class and never going to tutorials.
Dino Zorbas ,3.0,3.0,N/A,ok heres the deal. dont go to class... but stop by his office sometimes with a question... remember to leave ur name. DO PAST FINALS!! 3/6 questions come from past finals
Dino Zorbas ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"Hydro-Quebec, need I say more."
Dino Zorbas ,3.0,1.0,N/A,nice man but can't teach
Dino Zorbas ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"Funny guy, lean but repetition"
Nathan Friedman ,2.0,5.0,B,"Assignments were hard as heck. I am not a coder at all and it was the hardest class of all. The lectures seem really easy and then you get to the assignments and its wayyy harder than the lecture notes. The midterm was easy, final was hard (multiple choice were easy, but the long answer coding question are really hard). Goodluck to the non ECSEs."
Nathan Friedman ,2.0,4.0,N/A,"Horrible professor, extremely boring lectures like he's. Very patient and helpful outside of class only. Prepares well for questions in C programming for the final exam but non-existant preparation for MATLAB questions. All my knowledge for this course came from youtube, zybook and lecture slides."
Nathan Friedman ,1.0,5.0,N/A,Assignments are really tough
Nathan Friedman ,3.0,3.0,B+,"Very nice person, but very slow and methodical in his teaching to the point that his lectures become excessively long and repetitive. Honestly, it was very difficult to focus in his class, and I always felt like I was wasting my time by showing up to class. Like other people have said, take advantage of the online notes and textbook and past exams."
Nathan Friedman ,2.0,3.0,N/A,"He's really nice, seems to care about students a lot. Aside from that though he's just really really boring and it's impossible to concentrate. Better off doing the online textbooks and lecture slides than actually going to class."
Nathan Friedman ,3.0,3.0,N/A,"Lectures are very boring and as they are all posted online, you dont need to attend. Lots of assignments both programming and in the online textbook but really doable, especially if you go to the prof's or the TA's office hours. Beware that there will be many typos in your exams... But this prof really cares that people do well in his class"
Nathan Friedman ,3.0,3.0,A-,He is so sweet. Really helpful and nice if you go to his office hours. Seems to care about students despite his awfully boring lectures.
Nathan Friedman ,2.0,4.0,N/A,"lectures were *excruciatingly* boring. they were somewhat helpful, but youtube videos on the topic did a far more concise job at explaining.   course was pretty hard for some1 who's never programmed before, but it was pretty doable."
Nathan Friedman ,4.0,2.0,A+,"He is not a particularly exciting lecturer, but I really enjoyed the class and found the lectures valuable.  It is an easy class to get an A for. There are ample past papers, and the content is quite easy."
Nathan Friedman ,2.5,4.0,N/A,"Very confusing, doesn't explain really well. Going to class is almost useless, but the slides are good! Read them.  Exams are not easy. However, comp208 is a good class."
Nathan Friedman ,4.0,2.0,N/A,Really sweet guy.  Dedicated and cares about students. Enjoyed talking with him a few times after class.
Nathan Friedman ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"This professor knows a lot. If you seek help, he will help you enormously and will give you knowledge beyond what the class has to offer. I found him to be a very kind person as well. Would definitely take another course with him."
Nathan Friedman ,3.0,2.0,A,"With no previous programming experience, I was really confused at first. After a while, find myself really in to programming. Don't go to the tutorials and lectures, but do go over slides, do assignments by yourself, and do some programming on daily basis. Friedman is helpful if you ask for help, good teacher!"
Nathan Friedman ,3.0,2.0,A,Clear and easy
Nathan Friedman ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"He is a careful and clear teacher. People who dislike his lectures tend to already program and so get bored, or are just not enthusiastic students. The tests involve reading code and predicting what it will do which takes a lot of practice to not slip up on. You'll sometimes need someone who will sit with you and help debugunblank for assignments."
Nathan Friedman ,5.0,2.0,N/A,Great Professor. He is Very helpful!
Nathan Friedman ,3.0,2.0,A,"Attended the very first classes, had some interest at the time so would focus and follow him, learned the basics about coding back then. However, I got bored VERY fast and never attended classes after the first month. Force yourself to do the assignments though and do as many past exams as you can and you'll get an A"
Nathan Friedman ,4.5,3.0,B,"Great prof but can be boring if you didn't prepare before hand. Always do all the assignments as soon as they come out and buy the textbook (it helps with understanding programming). This course requires a lot of effort on the assignments but rest assured, if you do the assignments yourself, there is no need to study that hard for the final."
Nathan Friedman ,5.0,1.0,N/A,I loved him and his classes!! He is a great prof.
Nathan Friedman ,4.5,1.0,N/A,"Good prof, if you haven't done any coding before, read the slides/skim book before going to class and pay attention to class and you'll do fine. People who complain are those that don't know how to code and don't put in the time to learn. To programmers: Good class to for a refresher in C and the oddity that is Fortran."
France Bouthillier ,1.5,4.0,N/A,"She could not care less about the educational value of her students. She's worried about relations with ""Clients"" for whom we're doing free work. There's something seriously wrong with the Chair of the Department telling everyone in the course that ""Concordia University is not at a level that I would consider it a competitor to McGill."" Exact quote"
France Bouthillier ,2.0,3.0,N/A,"You have to do your assignments for a real client and France said, ""You will not embarrass McGill."" You know what's embarrassing? Having the majority of students and the co-instructor show up to the wrong classroom the first day and neglecting to put the only available copies of the textbooks on course reserves. This is CI in a nutshell."
France Bouthillier ,3.0,4.0,N/A,"Didn't really know what to expect. Very good class. Learned a lot. The book was extremely useful. Bouthillier is professional, fair, and helpful."
France Bouthillier ,1.0,5.0,N/A,No Comments
France Bouthillier ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"Worst, rudest professor I have ever met.  Insisted I didn't attend class because she didn't remember my face and she allegedly never forgets a face -- only I actually went to her lectures!"
France Bouthillier ,4.0,5.0,N/A,Hard class.  Huge workload. Must be prepared to work your butt off in this class. Did actually learn something  - a miracle in GSLIS.
Robin Rowley ,3.5,2.0,N/A,not useful to write anything since he is retired... BUT PROPS to prof. Rowley.  BY FAR the most knowledgeable and intelligent economic prof in the whole 3 years.  McGill just lost a great asset.  Good Retirement.  It's really something to be in one of his class.  Makes you learn so much more than normal econ classes.
Robin Rowley ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"Incredible professor.  Shows the 'other side' of economics & covers some very interesting material.  Follow his study tips, keep up with the eNotes (which are a bit annoying), and you'll do fine.  Be sure to get his feedback when working on your essay."
Robin Rowley ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"Smartest prof I have ever had.  Great lectures but exams are pure memorization. Chauvinistic attitude is a farce, but some people don't see that and are turned off by it."
Robin Rowley ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"His methods are unusual but they work. He usualy gives simple analogies and simple explanations but if you think about them further, there's more to what hes saying and he knows it. He knows what he's teaching and he's very intelligent, not to mention funny and sarcastic. Everyone should do his classes!"
Robin Rowley ,5.0,4.0,N/A,The the the BEST I've ever had!!!!!
Robin Rowley ,3.5,3.0,N/A,"This is the 'expand your mind' class of the honours course, it does an okay job, but his methods of evaluation are a bit sketchy.  Supposed to be opening our minds but he gives vanilla memorization exams.  Can be hard to approach but nice if he knows you, still though, tends to talk over you."
Robin Rowley ,5.0,4.0,N/A,one of the best around
Robin Rowley ,3.5,5.0,N/A,"A memorable professor with intelligence, attitude, and funny stories.  Worked my butt off and learned a lot from him, most of it good, but he always kept me guessing about the grade.  Still there are better researchers out there and he could be a bit more humble..."
Robin Rowley ,2.0,3.0,N/A,"I bet he's best friends with Dickinson. except he thinks he dresses better. just as proud as the rest of the male-dominant econ dept at mcgill, talks about his accomplishments and family a lot and just brushes over important material, but overall keeps the subject matter interesting"
Robin Rowley ,5.0,5.0,N/A,Certainly no doubt the best professor I have ever had. He makes you think and understand unlike other professors who could care less. He command on the subject and his comments make the class interesting and challenging. One can certainly learn a lot
Robin Rowley ,1.0,1.0,N/A,"class is a joke; pompous and boring, didn't learn a thing"
Robin Rowley ,5.0,3.0,N/A,Potentially one of the best professors in the department.  He knows what he's talking about and will always help out students - you can tell by the huge lines at his door during office hours.  He is however somewhat ambiguous about marks
Robin Rowley ,4.0,4.0,N/A,Knows his stuff... Can be nice ;)
Robin Rowley ,1.0,4.0,N/A,Too vague. What the hell is he teaching?
Robin Rowley ,3.0,2.0,N/A,man certainly likes to talk
Robin Rowley ,3.5,5.0,N/A,No Comments
David Harpp ,5.0,3.0,A,Dr. Harpp is truly a gem! He is 80 smth now but is still passionate about mcgill. He explains very clearly and compassionate. Just buy notes and memorize every lil thing and u'll be fine. Dont rly have to listen to the video lectures but is better to have the profs' voice accompanying for sure.
David Harpp ,5.0,2.0,A,"I have taken Chem 180, 181 and 183 because of professor Harpp. He is hilarious, articulate, caring and makes grading criteria very clear and fair. He wants the best for students, and will make sure everyone had a great experience in his classes."
David Harpp ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"Tons of memorization, and irrelevant info to keep in mind. Dr Harpp, on the other hand, is truly a fantastic prof and very understanding about students with disabilities. As a student with a neurodevelopmental condition however, I just hope that they keep improving their classes including more of the interactive videos and the new quiz system."
David Harpp ,1.0,2.0,A,"Not a hard class. This prof on the other hand is a piece of work. He is very old, takes slowly, is completely unorganized and goes on tangents about completely irrelevant topics. You will think that these are irrelevant but THEY WILL BE ON THE Exam. Make sure to memorize the details about his favorite paintings if you want an A."
David Harpp ,2.0,4.0,N/A,"One of the most boring while still difficult courses I've ever taken in my life. 3 hour lecture, and Dr. Harpp has a very monotonous voice. He often goes on tangents about things that sound like they don't matter, and then those things turn up on the exams (which are much harder than I thought they'd be). Wanted a bird course, got a hard course."
David Harpp ,4.0,4.0,N/A,"harder than I thought it would be and lectures are very long and boring. you need a friend in that class to keep you motivated to show up. midterm and final are all multiple choice, although the course is very heavy on memorization of words that all sound the same, so the exams were hard"
David Harpp ,4.0,3.0,A,Good prof. Knows what he is doing and gives the lectures well. But his voice made me sleepy :( I had to refer to the lecture recordings a lot to note down points I missed in class.
David Harpp ,5.0,2.0,A,Very interesting class! Great professor. He is very knowledgeable and you can tell he is very passionate. Strongly recommend taking this class.
David Harpp ,5.0,2.0,N/A,Such a nice prof! You learn everything you need for the exam in the lectures. He just wants you to do well.
David Harpp ,3.0,3.0,A,"Solid prof - but let's be honest, for CHEM 181 you can basically just skip the lectures and buy NTCs and get an A."
David Harpp ,2.5,4.0,A-,"His classes were very lecture style, but it really seemed like he was rambling at times rather than teaching. Many of his tangents appeared on the exam. He wasn't that clear with what was expected of us and didn't give nearly enough examples."
David Harpp ,2.0,5.0,N/A,"he is so rude... and not understanding at all... his matieral is dry and brings down the overall mood... his test, well lets say THEY HAVE ALMOST NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT YOU LEARN. rediculous professor"
David Harpp ,4.5,1.0,N/A,"He is the best teacher I had, he is very lively and makes his classes everything but boring. Even at 8am he manages to wake you up and prepare you for a long day.  He gives a meaning to chemistry and he knows how to make you laugh by dancing or singing. PS: Dr Harpp if you ever see this, WE LOVED the picture you took of a penguin with blue feet."
David Harpp ,4.5,1.0,N/A,"Although I took chemistry because I had to and not because I wanted to, this prof made me like the class!"
David Harpp ,4.5,2.0,N/A,Well respected prof who's been teaching at Mcgill for a long long time. He knows chemistry well and truly enjoys his research and teaching. Exam is fair and he posts recordings going through last year's exam in details which is super helpful. Best chemistry prof so far and would definitely take his class again!
David Harpp ,2.5,4.0,C,Thought course was supposed to be a bird course so I took it to fulfill my freshman arts requirements. As a humanities girl this was NOT a bird course. Maybe its a different case for sci students. I worked my ass off in the end to pass. Both profs were good. It was a huge class so they were accommodating as they could be for dif issues.
David Harpp ,5.0,2.0,N/A,Exceptional professor who has compassion for students with chronic medical conditions and disabilities. He was the most understanding re granting necessary accommodations.
David Harpp ,5.0,3.0,N/A,Excellent professor who really cares about his students!!
David Harpp ,4.0,4.0,N/A,Good prof
David Harpp ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"Wonderful prof. Very clear, fair exam, interesting. He can get a little monotonous but he's still one of the best profs at McGill."
Bill Watson ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"William Watson really fuels interest in the subject he teaches. He isn't the best lecturer, they are sometimes long and hard to stay focused on. However he promotes intelligent participation, you may answer the midterm questions using graphstextmaths, whichever suits you most, and the material is up-to-date and interesting. Would Recommend."
Bill Watson ,3.0,3.0,N/A,A gentleman and scholar
Bill Watson ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"Prof. Watson, while a respectable economist, is mostly a mediocre lecturer.  His grading practices are what really upset a lot of us. Curving down the exams for a perfect 70 average resulted in a lot of uneven grading. Expect a grade 10 marks less than your raw grade without good reasons, even if you study hard and are interested >.<"
Bill Watson ,2.5,3.0,N/A,"Stay away from 409. This prof is a complete tool when it comes to grading. Have you seen someone scoring 84/100 in the final and ending with a C+? You will see it in his class, because he wants a median of 70 so even if you do very well in your final, chances are you won't get an A."
Bill Watson ,3.0,3.0,N/A,"Watson is a fair guy. The material he choses to teach you is often based off current events. It can be a bit boring since the class is at 8:30, especially if you don't do the readings, but the material isn't overly complicated so you can follow along. His exams are fair, not too complicated. Watson is a nice guy, but apathetic at times."
Bill Watson ,3.0,1.0,N/A,"Great prof! Recommended for any third or final year students who wants to learn where economic knowledge can be applied in the real world. He is very up to date with current financial and economic affairs. 830AM class is a pain, but worth it. There are piles of readings but they are far from boring. He is also very helpful and insightful if you ask"
Bill Watson ,1.0,2.0,N/A,Booring guy. period
Bill Watson ,4.5,2.0,N/A,Easy enough to do well and very interesting in the upper level courses. You read articles about current issues of interest rather than theory out of a textbook and other stupidity. If you want to you'll actually learn something interesting here.
Bill Watson ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Not easy, but a wonderful teacher and person."
Bill Watson ,2.5,4.0,N/A,"once, he spent the whole class reading all of the exports and imports between canada and the U.S. that have ever been traded ""Dental drills, Dental chairs, jam, bacon..."" fascinating material."
Bill Watson ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"Watson is a great professor - I've had him for several classes. He's really into what he does, and wants students to come away from economics with an ability to analyze real-world issues (not just theory). If you know the readings very well you'll do fine on the final. Not many profs as good as him!"
Bill Watson ,3.5,2.0,N/A,"He is a fair guy...good guy too.  The lectures are unbelievably boring, especially if you haven't done the readings for class which most people don't. I hear the class will be at 8.30 am next year...You're probably not gonna go so make sure you read the readings WELL and you'll do great."
Bill Watson ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"Still good, but much better for 400 level courses where he doesn't repeat stuff nearly as much and can really talk about more interesting articles and the details of the economics behind them."
Bill Watson ,3.5,3.0,N/A,"Watson is a good professor, and the globalization seminar is pretty interesting. Just keep his biases in mind when listening to his lectures, and make sure you edit your papers at least 10 times. The class isn't too hard, and he is a fair (but not easy) marker."
Bill Watson ,3.0,1.0,N/A,"Watson's funny in a dry sort of way. Class is easy if you do all the readings, I went to 20% of the classes and got an A. All Watson does is discuss readings in class, so do the work yourself and you're fine. Class average was 72. If u don't like to read, don't take this class,the readings's intense"
Bill Watson ,4.0,2.0,N/A,"Umbelievable prof. A pleasure going to class and being taught by a reknown and well-respected economist. Very fair in grading and makes time for, and cares for his students. Great communication and makes WebCT very user-friendly. I guess there are good ECON profs out there!"
Bill Watson ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"very well spoken, makes current economic problems very interesting even to non-econ students like me, answers questions well, very fair about questions on midterm that kids complained about, readings are longish, but he explains well, easily offended by kids talking in class, cuz he really cares."
Bill Watson ,5.0,2.0,N/A,I'm a big fan of Watson. He's a great economic mind always willing to help his students. The class material was provocative and informative. I would highly recommend taking his first year seminar.
Bill Watson ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"He's a nice prof who's ready to help his students. There's a lot of readings to do and his lectures can be boring at times but overall, you learn a lot from his classes."
Bill Watson ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"Bill's a great teacher who commands respect, but it's easy to fall asleep and the material gets boring and repetitive after he starts to talk about it for a few classes.  Overall, he makes current economic problems more interesting than it really is."
Lucia Benaquisto ,5.0,3.0,N/A,She's simply amazing.  She makes me want to major in Soc.
Lucia Benaquisto ,2.5,3.0,N/A,"OK, the prof is kind of irresponsible by canceling the last lecture without prior notice and leaving some of us still very confused about the material. Her style is quite disorganized plus and material itself (methodology) is pretty dry, it really takes a lot of perseverance to sit in class and concentrate. Not recommended unless you are obligated!"
Lucia Benaquisto ,2.5,2.0,N/A,Abrasive. Prepare to be berated.
Lucia Benaquisto ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"This prof's lectures are the most scattered, confusingly-delivered classes I've experienced. The course content is heavy, but it would have been understandable had it not been for her disorganized speaking. Run away."
Lucia Benaquisto ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Love the class & the prof. Is very coherent & makes taking stats bearable. Makes funny remarks every now & then; tests are straight-forward & overall, a great prof!"
Lucia Benaquisto ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"Very good prof. Take her for 211, she knows what she is talking about and makes it seem so simple the way she breaks down the chapters. She is also a very fair marker, the TAs are great also."
Lucia Benaquisto ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"Benaquisto is like the best prof for this class. If you have never done inquiry or stats, take her. She is clear and goes really slowly(sometimes too slowly!)to make sure everybody understand her.She repeats a lot too.Very approachable.I learned a lot from that class and she is very sweet and knows the subject really well.Lots of material though."
Lucia Benaquisto ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"Granted, this was a seminar (12 people) and very different from a lecture structured class, but she is amazing. A brilliant woman who cares about her work, makes you care about your work, and is engaging the entire time. A professor where 10 years down the road you'll feel blessed to have been given the opportunity to study under her."
Lucia Benaquisto ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"She is awesome!  There is so much that one can learn from this woman....and I've studied her stuff in other courses as well.  She's also a very caring person.  Take her classes, if she's teaching any!"
Lucia Benaquisto ,1.0,5.0,N/A,I dropped this class-- enough said.
Lucia Benaquisto ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"She is a great teacher, dunno why ppl complain so much!! Very knowledgeable, willing to help you if you give it a try, and the book (which she wrote) is crystal clear with plenty of examples. Very clever, maybe that's why dummies couldn't understand?!"
Lucia Benaquisto ,2.5,5.0,N/A,"This class is HARD & BORING. If this class is a prereq, take it in the summer! If not, stay clear! The material is SO dry. Book isn't much help cuz it's written by the prof, who made it  as confusing as the lectures. To do well, stay on top of everything!"
Lucia Benaquisto ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"she's really good (phd from Harvard), clever and entertaining. great prof"
Lucia Benaquisto ,3.5,5.0,N/A,"This class is a nightmare! The tests are very hard and she's a hard marker (way too picky). Hard work doesn't pay off. Avoid this class unless it's a prereq. Lots of reading, needlessly complicated paper, fast-paced lectures, boring material. *gag*"
Lucia Benaquisto ,3.0,3.0,N/A,"she is crazy... she marks really hard... she had to majorly curve the midterm so more people would pass... if this class a pre-req i wouldn't recommend it... stay on topic of the readings, very nit picky when it comes to marks.."
Lucia Benaquisto ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"Most sutdents have been complaining about her but I really think she is a great teacher. Very intelligent, she will answer any question and the material is pretty straightforward - if ppl work a minimum, there is no way they can fail!"
Lucia Benaquisto ,4.0,5.0,N/A,"Nice professor, but very difficult exams. She tries to make it interesting but expects you to know everything and if you don't you lose marks on anything she gives you (exam,assignment). I think she tries to teach too much material in too little time."
Lucia Benaquisto ,3.0,5.0,N/A,She is kind of crazy... and her class is so annoying.  I guess she is a good teacher if you can actually sit through her class and listen to her annoying blabber.  This class is a lot harder that ou would expect it to be.
Lucia Benaquisto ,2.0,4.0,N/A,"Unfortunately, although she knows her stuff, she is totally psychotic. I feel like she actively tried to turn people off sociology. She ended up having to bump the midterm mark up 15% so MOST PEOPLE WOULD PASS!"
Lucia Benaquisto ,4.5,2.0,N/A,"Social Inquiry - she's like your mom, if your mom was actually cool. it was kind of rude for her to say ""don't email me"", and she's cute and funny in a dorky way. you'll like her, you'll like going to her class."
T.V. Paul ,4.0,3.0,A-,"Overall a really nice prof, who knows his material really well. The only complaint that sometimes he will go through things quickly. Apart from sometimes being a little fast, he's really easygoing and nice. 100% will take another class with him if there's something that piques my interest. When you have a prof that wholesome it's a great time."
T.V. Paul ,5.0,2.0,A,One of the best professors I have taken at McGill. He was engaging and funny. The lecture slides gave an outline of how to learn. So that was helpful in the exams
T.V. Paul ,4.0,3.0,A+,"Many readings and he doesn't do presentation decks- you are expected to take notes. Alot of material is covered in each class. He is a funny guy so if you catch his attention, he will similarly engage you further and this help with the participation grades. He seemed like a tough grade but I did alright overall -I believe the participation mattered"
T.V. Paul ,5.0,3.0,A-,"Thoroughly enjoyed his classes. They are inspirational and if you attend & listen, you gain a lot of knowledge- sure to help in the long run in IR/Asia. He's really knowledgeable &makes the ideas coherent to understand and grasp. +Funny. Best part: adds an academics perspective at the end of each class. One of the best professors I've had in Poli."
T.V. Paul ,2.0,4.0,N/A,"PRO: Hilarious and smart prof, very nice as a person, makes you participate in lectures, interesting content overall. CONS: Lectures often unclear. Don't always have time to take notes. Also, as he reads his speech and does not give a lot of visual content (1 slide / class), hard to stay focused. Tough exams (super specific IDs) and many readings."
T.V. Paul ,4.0,3.0,A+,"His lectures are at times unfocused, but nevertheless essential to succeeding in the course, in addition to the coursepack. Brilliant professor who clearly knows his material. That being said, although his book was excellent, I would have liked to study more recent cases as well. Looking into his upper level seminar class"
T.V. Paul ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"Really nice and funny prof, always ready to talk if you go to office hours. His lectures are fairly interesting, but he goes by pretty fast and when its 8am and he talks with a bit of an accent, it can be somewhat difficult to get everything down if you're a slow note taker. Overall really good class, go to lectures and skim the readings. "
T.V. Paul ,2.5,3.0,N/A,"Agreeable prof. Lectures were fairly disorganized and hard to follow, their ""objective"" wasn't made clear enough, but it is possible to do well if you are interested and study regularly."
T.V. Paul ,3.0,3.0,N/A,"He prepares his lectures last minute, so his lectures are only really decent when it's based on his own work;smart and interesting. However, based off the actual classes, we weren't really prepped for the final exam worth 50%. Most of the IDs were obscure from the lecture, and much of what we studied was not broached. Still interesting an class. "
T.V. Paul ,1.0,4.0,N/A,"A course with so much potential, but such a disappointment. He talks about security, but does not use any current literature or case study. the most current case was probably the Vietnam war and most articles you have to read were written before the cold war ended. so much good stuff has ever since been written about security in the last years.  "
T.V. Paul ,3.5,3.0,N/A,"Really approachable professor, but not the most clear lecturer. Exams are not too difficult, and material mainly comes from the readings."
T.V. Paul ,3.5,2.0,N/A,"Nice guy and approachable. Class will give you a general outline of a story the ID portion of the exams will come from here, so go to them. As for the essay part: read the course pack. You'll be good if you do, since the TA mostly marks exams and he/she will mostly derive most of the theory from there. Overall, you'll learn a lot from this class"
T.V. Paul ,4.0,2.0,N/A,Really knowledgeable professor.
T.V. Paul ,2.5,3.0,N/A,"Cute and affable exterior, but avoids every concievable point of interest in the course. And he's got himself a clever little scheme; the reader he makes you buy (his won, naturally) is re-released every year with minimal changes, so used ones can't be re-sold in the book store. Major ripoff."
T.V. Paul ,1.0,5.0,N/A,Seems to go out of his way to pick the most confusing readings and never really elaborates. He's highly disorganized and very boring in lectures.
T.V. Paul ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"TV Paul is one of the best professors at McGill, very sweet and solid. he knows his stuff He is very approachable and really helpful if you go speak with him. His lectures were clear and organized as long as you were still awake."
T.V. Paul ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"absolute crap. i don't know who let this guy become a professor, but he has no business being in the education profession. the course was unorganized, with lots of irrelevant or incomprehensible material, and way too much to learn. if you have to take it, do 243 first if u want to keep your sanity."
T.V. Paul ,3.0,3.0,N/A,"I thought the course was interesting but lectures were quite boring. The Midtern marks were EXTREMELY harsh whereas the FINALS were rather lenient... Heavy emphasis on Readings, an A IS possible without doing them however ;)"
T.V. Paul ,3.5,4.0,N/A,Funny guy. class is pretty hard though.
T.V. Paul ,3.5,3.0,N/A,"This is definitely a hard intro course, and though dry at times, worthwhile. TV Paul is a lovely, widely-accomplished man, and enjoys the material and his students. In class and when studying, go by his outlines. The conferences are a must, and studying for exams in a study group is ideal."
Bruce Arndtsen ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"What an awesome professor. I used to hate organic but he made me love it. Very clear in his lectures, helpful in answering questions, goes at a good pace, and exams are very fair. He'd rather test you on everything with fair (and sometimes easy) question than focus on 2 chapters and ask the toughest questions. Definitely take him if you can!"
Bruce Arndtsen ,5.0,3.0,N/A,His lectures are extremely clear and he goes at a good pace. His classes weren't boring at all. Exams were fair.
Bruce Arndtsen ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"Best prof's I have ever had at mcgil. Super super helpful, always nice in office hours, replied to your email the same day. material very clear, a lot of practice which is great. Got above 85 on both midterms and found final very nice ans straight forward got an A in the course.I have never met someone so willing to help you outside class!"
Bruce Arndtsen ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"Great prof, one of my favourites. Really good at explaining the material and asnwering questions, but you need to go to class to do well. Know the material he taught in class and you'll do well on the exams. Didn't really use the textbook at all. Listens to student input on exams and adjusted the marks based and what was said about the difficulty."
Bruce Arndtsen ,4.5,1.0,N/A,"Great prof, worth getting up for at 830.  Always available in his office and didn't mind spending time to basically tutor you.  Very fair marker, course was minimal work.  Know the trends and how to justify your answer and your going to get almost full points no matter the answer you put.  Good prof, good sense of humor"
Bruce Arndtsen ,4.5,1.0,N/A,"Very clear and concise. Speaks at a relatively fast pace, so you should be on the ball during his lectures. Midterms were fair. The final was quite difficult, but I am certain he curved. Overall, an excellent course."
Bruce Arndtsen ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Best professor I've had in a long time.  Knows his material, is passionate about it, and presents it in a manner most appealing."
Bruce Arndtsen ,4.5,2.0,N/A,He was an adequate teacher. Lectures were clear and the section was not too difficult.
Bruce Arndtsen ,1.0,5.0,B,Terrible prof
Bruce Arndtsen ,4.0,3.0,B,"Arndstern's a good prof (just as good as Wiseman and Fenster). Everyone is just tired of chemistry by the time his section comes. His lectures are clear and comprehensible, and his section really isn't hard, if you watch the lectures and read the notes."
Bruce Arndtsen ,1.0,4.0,B,Crap
Bruce Arndtsen ,3.5,4.0,B,B-O-R-I-N-G
Bruce Arndtsen ,1.0,3.0,B,i took chem 110 in fall 2004. arndtsen was one of my chem 110 professors but how does he look like? heheh i didnt go to his class once.
Bruce Arndtsen ,4.5,2.0,B-,"I think he's a really great prof. replies emails, unlike Fenster. By the end of the semester, people get burnt out and lazy.I really thought his section was the easieast one. But bad timing. Overall, he is a great prof. He is an american but he's been Canadianized! He's very helpful and cares for us"
Bruce Arndtsen ,4.0,2.0,B-,"His lectures were fast-paced...but he had to complete more material than Wiseman and Fenster. His section also covered the most challenging information. Nice prof, willing to help outside of class."
Bruce Arndtsen ,2.5,4.0,B-,"So this guy's pretty arrogant. He think's he's all that, but really.he's not. He tries to be funny, but it ends up being only him that's laughing. Well maybe those who brown-nose r laughing too.lol. He goes super fast, i missed a lecture, and I had to stop it every few slides to try to understand it"
Bruce Arndtsen ,4.0,3.0,B-,"I don't get why Arndsten gets such poor ratings... he's really a good teacher. Much better than most first year McGill profs. Sometimes his lecture notes are out of order (it's so frustrating!) but in general, I've been able to focus in his class really well."
Bruce Arndtsen ,4.0,2.0,A-,great prof...he's ok!
Bruce Arndtsen ,5.0,3.0,A-,"I can't believe people didn't like him. The guy's awesome, the material's kinda boring, but e can't help that. He did all he could, man."
Bruce Arndtsen ,3.0,4.0,A-,"Ok, but BORING"
Mark Andrews ,4.5,3.0,N/A,"Prof Andrews is a lovely guy. He is clearly very interested in what he teaches and often smiles or laughs at some of the things he presents which is always nice to see. The content is fairly difficult but the assignments, midterm and final are all take home so it allows you to keep the content close to guide you along the way. Very easygoing Prof"
Mark Andrews ,4.5,1.0,A-,"Take-home quiz, mid-term, exam, and everything. Doesn't mean the material is easy, in fact I'd say the material is pretty challenging. But Prof. Andrews teaches it in a way that you feel everything you are learning in class has its use and importance in research and in the real-world. Extremely easy-going. Highly recommended."
Mark Andrews ,4.5,2.0,A,"Dr. Andrews is an inspirational professor who is widely knowledgeable.  In his class, one learns a lot of Science which is up-to-date and directly relevant to hottest research in a variety of areas.  He actively integrates the class into discussions and teaches Science as it should be taught. I simply describe his teaching style as FLAWLESS. "
Mark Andrews ,4.0,4.0,A,V.Friendly and Easy-going
Mark Andrews ,5.0,3.0,A,Excellent professor
Mark Andrews ,4.5,3.0,A,"One of the best professors I have had in my Chemistry degree, I wishhim the best, everyone loves him"
Mark Andrews ,1.0,5.0,A,No Comments
Mark Andrews ,5.0,5.0,A,I love the name
Mark Andrews ,1.0,5.0,A,Where is this professor ???? Is he still alive ??? I'm wondering if he has not been kidnapped by E.T. ... Too bad for my business !
Mark Andrews ,3.5,3.0,A,No Comments
Sarah Stroud ,5.0,4.0,N/A,Stroud is a genius. Amazing lectures and readings. Some of the contents in this class actually changed my whole worldview. Very hard marker
Sarah Stroud ,2.0,4.0,N/A,I'm not really sure why the grading was so ruthless for an entry level course. She's a lovely person and great lecturer but I was very thrown off with the essay feedback.
Sarah Stroud ,4.0,3.0,B+,"Professor Stroud gives really captivating lectures that are ESSENTIAL towards the course work (3 papers, 1 final). Yes, there is a lot of reading, but I managed to pull a B+ without reading 2/3 texts because her lectures covered the material so thoroughly."
Sarah Stroud ,5.0,4.0,B+,"Amazing professor who truly cares about what she teaches. The course material will be tough if you don't attend lecture. Her evaluation of the text is super useful for your papers, so I would take advantage of lectures AND conferences."
Sarah Stroud ,2.0,4.0,N/A,"She's very nice but infuriatingly slow in lecture. She repeats herself ad nauseam. Her pace would be bearable if her TAs weren't such harsh graders. You have to follow strict guidelines on the papers in order to get anything above a B. I've done well in upper year philosophy courses and got a poor mark in this class, so I wouldn't take her again."
Sarah Stroud ,5.0,4.0,A-,"I love Sarah Stroud, I wish I could take more classes with her but I took her ethical theory class in my last semester at McGill. Her lectures are super clear and she definitely commands the room. The grading is a bit tough, but she is so clear in her expectations and tells you exactly what she's looking for in her papers."
Sarah Stroud ,5.0,5.0,A-,Lectures were very clear though didn't go terribly deep - really just explained the readings. Very tough marker. Definitely advise going to office hours and class.
Sarah Stroud ,5.0,4.0,B+,A very passionate professor! She is very friendly to students and enthusiastic to what she is teaching! Absolutely recommend!
Sarah Stroud ,4.0,3.0,B+,"Pretty slow pacing in class, but the content of 230 and 334 is interesting and stroud is great at explaining things, and is clearly extremely passionate about her work. Almost all of the readings for 334 are extremely interesting and rewarding, although they're quite hard"
Sarah Stroud ,5.0,5.0,A,"Sarah Stroud is one of the best profs I have had. Amazing lecturer that loves the material she teaches and manages to infect students with her enthusiasm. However, I worked harder to pull off an A in this 200-level class than I did for many of my 3-400 levels. Over all though? WELL worth it if you are ready to take on the challenge. 3papers, 1final"
Sarah Stroud ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"An absolutely amazing professor. She always teaches with incredible enthusiasm so her passion shines through. The material is definitely world view changing. However, the class requires a fair amount of reading (30 pages per week of dense hundreds of years old philosophy). Also, papers are very hard to do well in. Do EXACTLY what the prompt wants."
Sarah Stroud ,5.0,4.0,B+,"One of my favourite professors in the department, amazing lectures. You can tell she is passionate and incredibly involved in metaethics (the class and her field of specialization). Quite a harsh grader and you need to know all your readings well but she motivates you to do them all tbh, love her!"
Sarah Stroud ,1.0,5.0,N/A,You won't do well in this class unless you follow her exact guidelines. Essays follow the same format and there isn't room for freedom.
Sarah Stroud ,2.0,4.0,N/A,"She is very clear in her lectures & takes time to go over concepts until they feel simple. I enjoyed the lectures, but the papers were hard (we had 3 and a final). The topics relate to what she focuses on, but you only get the topic 10 days before its due, averaging C+/B-, which I think is because of harsh grading rather than low quality papers."
Sarah Stroud ,2.0,4.0,A,"She wants a very specific type of essay, so most do poorly on the first one. Class average this year was around a 2.8 (TA told me). That being said, the material is very interesting and it is possible to get an A."
Sarah Stroud ,5.0,4.0,A-,"I adored Stroud. Her lectures were interesting and clear, but you have to do the readings and go to lectures. It really helps to take notes during the lectures for the papers, since she's explaining the material you're writing about. She is a very tough grader (B- class average or lower), but philosophy is a tough major. Would recommend!"
Sarah Stroud ,5.0,4.0,N/A,"I loved this class! The lectures were at 8:30 and I probably wouldn't have gotten up for a different class, but Prof Stroud's lectures were very interesting and extremely helpful with understanding the material. I absolutely loved her. I decided to become a philosophy major because of this course!"
Sarah Stroud ,3.5,4.0,N/A,"Super clear but takes forever to go through relatively basic material. Assigns a lot of reading, and the paper are harshly graded. "
Sarah Stroud ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Phenomenal lecturer who is quite accomplished in her field. She is a privilege to have at McGill. Neither of her courses are easy to get an A in, but she is entertaining, clear as can be, very fair, helpful, cheery, and she will not only make you fully understand the material but make you a smarter person. All first years should take Phil 230."
Sarah Stroud ,3.5,3.0,C,Very qualified but painfully patronizing in lecture. Assignments are heavy for a 200 level but beyond that they are fair.
Patrick Andre Mather ,5.0,1.0,A-,"Awesome professor, always available to help you in whatever you may need from him. Best educator I have met in my life."
Patrick Andre Mather ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"He teaches at CCNY now, and he's one of the best french teachers I've ever had. He speaks French mostly, but he always explains things in english, and makes it very clear. The homeworks and tests are easy. Teaches both 122 and 225. Great prof!"
Patrick Andre Mather ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"Very nice, cute, helpful."
Patrick Andre Mather ,5.0,2.0,N/A,Oh he's just adorable and a great professor
Patrick Andre Mather ,4.5,1.0,N/A,excellent prof. his questions are fair.his classes are never boring. just work and you'll get good marks with him.
Patrick Andre Mather ,5.0,2.0,N/A,"Brought my French to a usable level!  If he doesn't get far professionally, it's only because he likes actually *teaching* too much for the jerks who run academia."
Gil Troy ,2.0,3.0,N/A,"This was the class I was most looking forward to at the start of the semester, but it soon turned into the one I least looked forward to attending each week. Not only was the professor RARELY at lecture, but when he was there, he lectured in an arrogant manner."
Gil Troy ,2.0,4.0,N/A,"Great lectures, packed with information but very entertaining. A lot of reading but for the most part  relevant and interesting. He marks pretty hard for the midterm and the paper but the paper was open ended and allowed you to research something you were interested in. Tons of information to know for final but ended focusing on themes not details."
Gil Troy ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"A great introduction to modern American history. It was extremely rushed through, but I suppose that's the purpose of a survey course. There are tons of readings for a 200 level, but they're mostly quite relevant and interesting. I did enjoy the books he wrote. However, I questioned some of the books' relevance, such as the one on women's history."
Gil Troy ,1.5,5.0,N/A,"As mentioned, missed a ridiculous amount of classes. Because of the amount missed, there were movies and ""filler"" materials used when Troy did not show up. I was very excited to take this class, and was left extremely disappointed."
Gil Troy ,1.0,4.0,N/A,"If he had told us how many lectures he would be missing at the beginning of the year I would not have taken this class. Extremely unreasonable amount of reading assigned. Final exam was way too long. Asks you to write argumentative essays, with approximately 4 prompts calling for description in each question. Erratic lecture style. DO NOT TAKE."
Gil Troy ,2.0,3.0,N/A,"As everyone else has mentioned, erratic lecture style/course organization, irresponsible number of lectures missed, unrealistic number of readings, and an overall overwhelming final exam. It's a shame for a course that had so much potential."
Gil Troy ,2.5,4.0,N/A,"I was really looking forward to this class, but it did not live up to its potential. I will refrain from repeating the same criticisms listed below. What  disappointed me was the content. While I was expecting a course where we discussed historical events, our t.a. was mainly focused on the writing styles of authors, rather than say, campaigns..."
Gil Troy ,1.5,5.0,N/A,"There is an obscene amount of reading for this class that you'll drown in. Plus, he missed a ton of lectures, and when he's there for lectures, he talks so fast it's difficult to retain much information. He's an interesting lecturer though, and knows his stuff - he just doesn't know how to teach it properly. Wouldn't recommend this class."
Gil Troy ,1.5,4.0,N/A,"An already wide course is made incomprehensible by him missing tonnes of lectures, which are filled in by TA's who don't know the material. This combined with a ridiculous amount of readings, including Tory's own mediocre book, weekly 'mini' papers, and confusing take home, makes students ask: if Troy doesn't care about this course, why should I?"
Gil Troy ,2.0,3.0,N/A,"Professor Troy is without a doubt an entertaining orator. However, his lectures lack true structure. He missed more than half a dozen lectures, which made grasping the content as a whole very difficult. Number of readings is highly unreasonable. Entertaining lectures, interesting content, but try and take this course with someone else"
Gil Troy ,1.5,5.0,N/A,"Gil Troy is without a doubt an intelligent professor, yet it is clear that he is overly confident of his teaching skills. He confused the class by missing lecture after lecture and by not making any attempt to make up for missed time. This class had great potential to be interesting (given the 2012 US election cycle), yet I was truly dissapointed."
Gil Troy ,2.0,2.0,N/A,"It is obvious that Troy is extremely intelligent and I have a lot of respect for him. He is also a great lecturer. However, he was frequently absent from class which I felt significantly hindered my learning. He gave off the impression he was too busy for his students. Nevertheless, the content was interesting."
Gil Troy ,3.5,5.0,N/A,"Intelligent man.  Not the best of educators.  Class lacks structure.  He is often absent.  A lot of readings that aren't all helpful or useful.  Could be a great course to take, but not with him at the helm.  He is very entertaining though.  I do not recommend the course with him as the prof."
Gil Troy ,3.5,5.0,N/A,"Missed 4 lectures in a row, and then did not provide any overview of what we missed (we watched videos while he was absent). Has a hard time providing structure to the course, and where most other lecturers will try to highlight important details, he just goes on. However, if you can get past this he is an amazing speaker and amazingly brilliant."
Gil Troy ,4.0,5.0,N/A,The most intellectually challenging course I took in my first year. Professor Troy really does care for his students and makes great strides to prepare them to be future historians. I highly recommend this course but be prepared to work.
Gil Troy ,3.5,4.0,N/A,Very clear and interesting. The work load is a lot and the class is a lot of work for first year.
Gil Troy ,3.5,5.0,N/A,seriously challenging course with tons of reading. But readings are very interesting and Troy is a great professor. Best course I've taken at McGill and best I've ever felt about my work.
Gil Troy ,4.0,3.0,N/A,"Really good prof, entertaining lectures. Readings are amazing, i still have some his books. He is not an easy marker though, especially when he marks the papers himself. Conferences are an easy 10%. Definitely recommend taking this course!"
Gil Troy ,2.5,3.0,N/A,"Troy should concentrate more on teaching his classes information than on entertaining them. He is not shy to let you know how intelligent he is (""I just came from a meeting at the White House...""). He's also a political hack, even though he tries to play like he isn.t In  US presidential campaigning he never once mentioned a 3rd party."
Gil Troy ,4.0,5.0,N/A,"really, really challenging course; but also the reason why it's he and his classes are so awesome. really gets you motivated. he expects a lot of effort and hard work, but in return you will learn a lot and really improve your essay writing skills. one of the best history profs i've had. very innovative teaching method."
Tom Velk ,5.0,3.0,B-,Tom Velk is awesome. I learned more than I knew I could
Tom Velk ,4.0,3.0,A-,"If you're looking for a GPA boost, probably not the best choice. If you're looking for a solid Pass/Fail course. strongly recommend Prof Velk. His lectures are amazing, he is  willing to debate diferent POVs, and he's a really cool guy. If you're easily offended and don't like hearing different opinions then here's your ""trigger warning."""
Tom Velk ,1.0,3.0,B-,"One of the worst experience in McGill. Just don't take him, you will lower you GPA. Strange grading, not interesting material, lazy teacher are all the ingredients of dissatisfaction with his course!"
Tom Velk ,1.0,3.0,N/A,"The guy is ALL Over the place. I mean come on, as I write this i still havent received my grades from him for the Fall semester... Ridiculous. Brilliant Professor but is one of the most disorganized humans I have encountered in my life. Doesnt seem to follow a plan and really just rambles on for the entire lecture."
Tom Velk ,2.0,2.0,A,Velk was hilarious but not a great prof.  Clearly a brilliant guy but his lectures and the course in general were all over the place.  Very average amount of work and not too hard to do well in.
Tom Velk ,2.0,1.0,N/A,"No exams, just weekly assignment questions. Lectures are just Velk spewing irrationally right-wing politics at the class, and have nothing to do with assignment questions. He definitely encourages students to voice their opinions, which is great. Take this class if you like politics, and if you aren't too offended by conservative politics."
Tom Velk ,5.0,3.0,A-,"The man is a legend, ya his disorganization may scare the freshmen but he is by far the most entertaining lecturer in McGill -unless you hate American politics. Class is elementary economics, not too difficult if you have a basic knowledge of macro and micro."
Tom Velk ,2.0,3.0,N/A,"he is going to make you read like there is no tomorrow. He skips from topic to topic and its not very clear. He's also in love with American history and politics. No midterms or final, just weekly Questions that take up a lot of time."
Tom Velk ,5.0,3.0,N/A,Right Wing beauty 100 % recommend
Tom Velk ,1.0,4.0,N/A,Worst class I have ever taken (no exaggeration). Professor is patronizing and cannot explain any topic. Classes and readings are boring and useless. Just go to the midterm and final review. Midterm is hard and final is super easy. This class made me contemplate changing my major/direction in life.
Tom Velk ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"For a guy who attempts to dress well (blazer + bowtie), he somehow manages to wear pants too long for his height, looking like a grimy and homeless leprechaun."
Tom Velk ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"The guy really loves to ramble and so do his readings. That's what makes his class so hard now, none of the resources are clear. I did not enjoy this experience at all, I would say it repelled me from economics."
Tom Velk ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"An extremely boring class that jumps from topic to topic without warning. There is not a friendly atmosphere in the class, as Velk mostly makes you work for everything without a hint of motivation or class-to-work link. Better off just looking up the material on the MIT open course Youtube channel. Better, more captivating, and more instructive."
Tom Velk ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"This class most definitely made me fiddle around with suicidal ideation. Don't. Just, please, do not make the mistake of this class. Velk is not fit to teach anymore."
Tom Velk ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"If you want to learn nothing, be driven insane and eventually fail, take this course! Total nightmare."
Tom Velk ,2.0,2.0,N/A,"Good class if you simply want to chill but learn nothing. Attendence means nothing. Do the portfolio (term paper) and prepare yourself through youtube vidio he posted on mycourses and do some basic scratches of ECON208/209 material, you will be fine. But he is a brilliant economist... just not good enough to be a lectueur..."
Tom Velk ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"The good times are over, folks. It's now high disappointment and low grades (as opposed to both being high). Velk's a hard teacher now, with all strings attached. Don't do it."
Tom Velk ,1.0,5.0,N/A,VERY VERY VERY bad
Tom Velk ,1.0,5.0,N/A,Not clear at all.
Tom Velk ,1.0,5.0,N/A,A mistake not worth repeating.
George Digiovanni ,5.0,3.0,N/A,"Professor di Giovanni is a real gem at McGill, and I learned a lot in his classes. Lectures are fascinating and engaging, and a wealth of historical background is brought to bear on the material. He is also hilarious and a very respected scholar in his field. Anyone interested in the history of philosophy should take his classes."
George Digiovanni ,5.0,1.0,N/A,"Brilliant man. If you do the work, you are in good hands. Very knowledgeable, very kind. My favourite professor."
George Digiovanni ,4.5,1.0,A,"He is the best prof. I have ever taken classes with! However, you have to put in the hard work."
George Digiovanni ,1.0,4.0,N/A,"IMPOSSIBLE to understand. His accent is really strong, his notes and thoughts are disorganized, if you haven't done the readings/don't hang onto every word he says, you're not going to get anything out of the lectures or out of him."
George Digiovanni ,3.5,3.0,N/A,"You really got to listen to him in class, if you want to know what to write in your paper. Once you do, you're in business, though, and he posts notes to help you read almost every text. His class requires autonomy and a bit of willigness to work on your own. Allows people to debate and ask questions. Great sense of humour too."
George Digiovanni ,4.0,2.0,N/A,"Took both the Kant and Hegel classes. Really great lecturer, not always clear but very few other profs have so much depth as well as breadth of knowledge. Though the material is extremely difficult, he grades pretty easily as long as you make an effort. If you want to hear a good rant/have a laugh, ask about Nietzsche"
George Digiovanni ,4.5,3.0,N/A,No Comments
George Digiovanni ,4.5,4.0,N/A,"Great prof; difficult, but worth it"
George Digiovanni ,4.0,2.0,N/A,"Unforgettable professor with a cool accent, great stories, and a sense of the big picture.  Sometimes he is completely impenetrable (and somewhat intimidating), but you can't blame him given the material-I don't believe in Kant, Hegel, or Fichte anymore.  Yes, his kids are actually pretty normal!"
George Digiovanni ,1.0,5.0,N/A,"Haughty person, not helpful. If you're not on his academic level, he doesn't want you to be. He's not there for u."
George Digiovanni ,5.0,2.0,N/A,What philosophy can be.
George Digiovanni ,3.5,4.0,N/A,"Horribly tangential at times, but overall a good prof;know his stuff cold;gives great overviews/'big pictures';helluva linguist"
George Digiovanni ,4.5,4.0,N/A,"Fantastic lecturer.  The material is very hard, but he definitely knows what he's talking about. If you're looking for something easy, this isn't for you."
George Digiovanni ,3.5,5.0,N/A,"No, he's not easy to follow.  True, you'll leave lecture with a headache, but for those true academics out there: you'll NEVER find a more interesting lecturer."
George Digiovanni ,2.5,3.0,N/A,"Sitting through the lectures was torture. If you want to learn about Kant, you'll have to do it on your own."
George Digiovanni ,4.5,2.0,B+,"Lectures to the heart of philosophy giving his attention to thinkers' insights, to what they got right, rather than wasting time with simplifications that remain on the level of terminology.  Believes what he teaches."
George Digiovanni ,2.0,3.0,N/A,"He might know philosophy, but he not sharing it with the class. Seems to say whatever random thought comes to his mind."
George Digiovanni ,3.5,3.0,N/A,This guy is brilliant and hilarious.  Loved his misanthropy and antecdotes about teaching in the 70's.
George Digiovanni ,2.5,3.0,N/A,"George DiGiovanni understands Hegel, which means: (a) he is alone in the universe, and (b) nobody understands George DiGiovanni.  Best quote: ""I have never had an experience."""
George Digiovanni ,3.5,3.0,N/A,one of the most compelling lecturers. very funny. his passion for the subject matter comes through
